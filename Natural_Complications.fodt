   <text:p text:style-name="P190">The sky was dark and the moon full even though it was long after the sun should have risen. <text:s/>A ruined castle in the forest was the stage where it would be decided if the light of day would shine ever again. <text:s/>A small clearing within sight of the castle was host to a more subtle event. <text:s/>A single pop was the first hint of anything happening there but it was followed by series of them. <text:s/>They all emanated from a point in the center of the clearing just a meter off the ground. <text:s/>Joining the pops as they grew in frequency were arcs of electricity connecting with the ground. <text:s/>While all this was happening the battle for the day was drawing to a climax.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">As the final blow was struck the energy building in the clearing was released. <text:s/>A brilliant flash of light obscured everything while a final final deafening bang rang out. <text:s/>With the battle over the sun rose and illuminated the result of the energy in the clearing. <text:s/>A very confused woman stood in the center as the sun rose to take its place in the sky. <text:s/>She was a scrawny brunette of average height and looked like she had seen better days. <text:s/>Her green shirt and blue jeans had small tears in them and plenty of stains and accumulated dirt. <text:s/>As she surveyed her new surrounds she pulled her long hair back into a pony tail. <text:s/>It stayed in this new configuration even though there was nothing holding it together.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P191"><text:span text:style-name="T362">Audrey Anderson was not unaccustomed to suddenly finding herself in strange situation. <text:s/>She had been living in Manhattan during the release of a bioweapon, the Blacklight virus. <text:s/>It was the single most terrifying virus the world had seen as it infected and killed its victims in only a matter of minutes. <text:s/>Even worse it would reanimated the corpse to spread itself further. <text:s/>To her misfortune she was one of two people who merged with the virus instead of dying to the infection. <text:s/>In a matter of minutes she went from survivor to kill on sight by everyone. <text:s/>She did gain powers including shape shifting that let her survive as a consolation prize.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">Over the months she hide from the ones hunting her and developed her abilities. <text:s/>She found that she had a knack for acoustic and with the virus was able to learn her most used ability, sonar. <text:s/>She rarely ever turned it off as the ability to &apos;see&apos; anything coming from was invaluable. <text:s/>She was able to map out the surrounding forest nigh instantly using sonar. <text:s/>It also allowed her to sense the person who appeared right behind her. <text:s/>She turned on her heels ready for a fight and asked, “Who are you and how did you appear like that?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">“Good to see you made it here fine. <text:s/>I am the one who brought you here, as for my name you can use whatever you like, or one of the names I&apos;ve been given over the years. <text:s/>Gaea. Terra. Mother Earth not to be confused with Earth Mother which is also me. Janet from accounting, now there was an interesting experience. <text:s/>Most just go with that bitch.” the other woman answered and ticked off each of her names.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190"><text:soft-page-break/>She had a very stout body that looked to be chiseled out of stone if not for it being skin colored. <text:s/>Even though her height was well over two meters she appeared small from a distance. <text:s/>Her eyes were a deep green color and even had a slight glow to them. <text:s/>Her hair started as an ordinary brown but the further down its length vines were mixed in until there was only a tangle of vines at her feet. <text:s/>She also had not felt the need to wear any clothes. <text:s/>Taking in her appearance and words Audrey realized, <text:span text:style-name="T13">One of us is clearly insane, but I have no idea which.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">“So you are saying that you&apos;re a god that decided to whisk me away to some distant forest?” Audrey questioned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">“More avatar, than god. <text:s/>I suppose different planet counts as distant so, yes pretty much.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">“So then send me back.” Audrey said with a frown.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">“Not an option, nor do I see what you would want to go back to. <text:s/>Lucky, for you this time you&apos;re being force into an arrangement you will likely find mutually beneficial.” Gaea responded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">“...Fair point, but what do you mean by mutually beneficial?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">“That is something for us to find out, but I think that you will at least find this to be a much better place to live than your previous one.” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T363">Gaea answered before falling apart into a collection of moss covered rocks.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">“<text:span text:style-name="T363">I can see why people call you &apos;That Bitch&apos;.” <text:s/>Audrey sighed and pushed a rock over with her foot. <text:s/>Figuring there&apos;s no point in standing around Audrey looked for some interesting landmark to go toward. <text:s/>The only one turned out to be the castle so she made her way to it. <text:s/>The large chasm separating her from the castle but she was able to cross it by stretching her limbs and adding some webbing so she could glide.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P193"><text:span text:style-name="T54">What in the hell is this, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">she thought when she peeked over the wall and saw some chariots with winged horses by them sitting in the overgrown courtyard. <text:s/>The horses were wearing golden armor and looked to be standing at attention. <text:s/>In order to get closer she shifted into the form of a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T249">maine coon cat</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248"> hoping that would not spook the strange horses. <text:s/>She walked right up to the carriages and hopped in as if she owned them. <text:s/>She was a cat after all. <text:s/>Now that she was closer she could see that they were not horses, but closer to ponies. <text:s/>The proportions were wrong, but that was the closest species she knew. <text:s/>Also they all had white coats and bright blue manes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P194"><text:span text:style-name="T70">She did not have to wait long before 8 more ponies exited the decrepit building that remained and got into the carriages. <text:s/>One of them was the size of an actual horse and entered a carriage with a much smaller blue pony. <text:s/>The other 6 all join Audrey in the carriage before noticing her. <text:s/>She got a variety of tilted heads and curious eyes from them before an orange coated one tried to shoo her away. <text:s/>Audrey was not going to leave that easily and remained in her spot. <text:s/>A yellow one with wings tried cooing to her in an unknown language and even resorted to trying to pick up the feline. <text:s/>Audrey was unmoved by this to the surprise of the ponies and another winged one with a blue coat also tried to lift her. <text:s/>This pony was stronger and even managed to pick up the cat but could not remove her once she dug her claws in. <text:s/>At that point the ponies just decided to leave the cat alone and head out.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body"><text:soft-page-break/>I did not expect the ponies to be drawing carriages of more ponies, <text:span text:style-name="T70">Wild marveled, </text:span>nor for the carriages to fly. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T70">The entire flight Audrey spent watching the ground speed by under her golden ride. <text:s/>The yellow flying pony from before had started to pet her and she returned it with a nuzzle before going back to the spectating. <text:s/>She had used the nuzzle as an opportunity to gain a sample of the pony&apos;s genes. <text:s/>Soon their destination was in sight, a small rustic town could be seen beyond the edge of the forest. <text:s/>The buildings had thatch roofs and timber frame walls. <text:s/>In the center of the town square was a three story tall round building. <text:s/>A few other buildings deviated from the common appearance like the gingerbread house and a tree with a door in it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P192"><text:span text:style-name="T70">The carriages landed with a thud in the middle of the town square and 8 ponies and one cat stepped off of them. <text:s/>Her fellow passengers watched as Audrey wandered off into the town making a few comments that she could not understand. <text:s/>Along with collecting additional samples from the ponies she would also need to find a way to learn the language. <text:s/></text:span>If only I knew anything about linguistics, <text:span text:style-name="T70">Midnight grumbled. <text:s/>She spent the whole day in Ponyville making a point to remember everything spoken near her. <text:s/>If nothing else she use her perfect recall to try learning from her memories. <text:s/>The DNA <text:s/>samples were easy to collect though. <text:s/>She would just walk up to random ponies and start rubbing against their legs and they would assume it was nothing more than a cat doing typical cat things.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P192"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Not long into her meandering a town wide party had started for some reason. <text:s/>Given the degree of golden ornaments on the carriages she rode in on Audrey figured it had something to do with the ponies she arrived with. <text:s/>Not being able to understand speech meant the only thing she got out of the party was some pilfered pastries. <text:s/></text:span>It has been forever since I got to eat anything baked, <text:span text:style-name="T70">Audrey gushed in her own mind, </text:span>this is almost enough to make being kidnapped worth it. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T70">She had laid down in the town&apos;s park since all of the ponies were busy with the party. <text:s/>She stretched out to enjoy the last rays of the sun before it started setting.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P192"><text:span text:style-name="T70">While she was resting in the middle of an open patch of grass she heard the sound of galloping hooves approaching. <text:s/>Looking in the direction of the sound she saw a pair of the golden armored ponies running up to her. <text:s/>A second later she detected a large object falling toward her. <text:s/>Checking toward the unknown object and thought, </text:span>That is one big bird... Aw shit. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T70">The bird looked like a light brown eagle except it was the size of a house and it landed </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T275">talons</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"> first on Audrey. <text:s/>A couple flaps that blew the ponies back and the bird was flying away with its catch.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P195"><text:span text:style-name="T249">“You bastard, I&apos;m going to kill you.” Audrey screamed and contorted her body in anatomically impossible ways to dig her claws into the side of her new abductor. <text:s/>To the protest of her ride she managed to claw her way to a one of its wing joints and bit down. <text:s/>With a loud snap and horrible screech the birds wing was ripped from its body. <text:s/>Audrey had made sure she was firmly attached as she rode her prey all the way to the forest floor.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P196"><text:span text:style-name="T249">T</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">he pair of ponies were still going after the bird, but were not expecting what they found in at the crash site. <text:s/>The bird was writhing on the ground, one wing missing the other detached and tossed in the nearby bushes. <text:s/>Its legs were mangled to the point of uselessness and a particularly large house cat was currently eating from its side. <text:s/>The cat gave them a short look and payed the ponies no more attention. <text:s/>The ponies retreated deciding to let nature take its course, the roc was no longer a threat so their job </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T70">was done.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179"><text:s text:c="2"/><text:span text:style-name="T249">It was well into the night by the time Audrey finished and not a trace of the roc was left. <text:s/>Reviewing its memories she found some interesting facts. <text:s/>Animals here were smarter than on Earth and this one had at least a rudimentary knowledge of words in the local language. <text:s/>More importantly she was not the only recent prey the roc had caught. <text:s/>It was a big bird and had a big appetite. <text:s/>It had left a mostly eaten body of a pony shaped creature with an insectoid carapace and compound eyes. <text:s/>Its eyes and a saddle like shell on its back were both pink. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">A crest on the back of its neck and a tail where both the same gray color as its chitin. <text:s/>Audrey could not think of any creature remotely close to this one. <text:s/>She had to collect a sample from it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179"><text:span text:style-name="T249"><text:s text:c="2"/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">She was able to find the body without too much trouble in the forest even though the memories where from the air. <text:s/>She did have to increase her body size making the forest a tighter fit. <text:s/>The roc was not interested in the creatures head so when Audrey consumed it she was able to get some memories. <text:s/>They were too damaged by time for any detail but she could tell that this was a sub-terrain species and a sapient one. <text:s/>It knew the same language as the ponies and combined with the knowledge of the roc Audrey had a working understanding of the language.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P180"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Audrey laid down against the nearest tree and closed her eyes. <text:s/>She wanted to work through her memories of the ponies speech and see if there was anything interesting in them. <text:s/>By the time that the sun rose she had worked through all of them and found very little. <text:s/>Most of it was small talk or variations of &apos;Oh look, a kitty&apos;. <text:s/>The only interesting she learned was that the yellow pegasus from earlier was actually trying to talk to her. <text:s/>For some reason those ponies found it surprising that a cat did not understand them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P180"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Getting up and stretching Audrey considered what to do today. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">I am way to fat to go back, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">she thought, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">but where am I going to put all of this biomass. I don&apos;t want to just dump it. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"><text:s/>She stopped in front of a large oak tree in the forest. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">That&apos;s big enough, but can I actually convert a plant.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"> <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T55">Well, might as well try. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T251">Walking up to the tree she stuck her claws into its trunk. <text:s/>At first nothing happened, but once the first cell was infected Audrey was able to improve her methods. <text:s/>Slowly the infection radiated out from her claws and soon was visible on the surface of the bark. A line of small black tendrils appeared encircling the punctures in the tree. <text:s/>The line spread out at an accelerating rate while everywhere they passed appeared exactly the same. <text:s/>Soon the line had run across the entire tree, but Audrey did not move. <text:s/>Instead she transferred most of her current mass into the tree until she could fit the remainder into the form of a young pony.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P181"><text:span text:style-name="T251">Using the DNA she collected yesterday Audrey created a pony form for herself. <text:s/>When she transformed a pony not much larger than her cat form stood in her place. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T56">Odd I thought I made this a 19 year old body, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261">she wondered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T56">Whatever, I can be a littler pony. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T251"><text:s text:c="2"/>She changed the color of her fur to a jade green and her mane to deep purple. <text:s/>Both her mane was long and fell below her withers and her tail was thick. <text:s/>Finally her eyes were a light gray. <text:s/>Now ready she made her way to the town in her brand new filly form using the name Wild Way.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P223" text:outline-level="1"><text:soft-page-break/>Chapter 2</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">On her way to out of the forest and to the town Wild Way was on autopilot. <text:s/>She had never actually been a tree before and wanted to explore some of the new sensation. <text:s/>Being able to use photosynthesis was a surprise treat. <text:s/>It felt to her like eating fresh buttery rolls combined with being wrapped in a warm blanket as some new kind of mixed sense she had. <text:s/>She had quickly set her tree up with the ability to hear and use sonar in order to keep some awareness of its surroundings. <text:s/>She also had the roots extend downward in order to map out the sub-terrain space.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">She realized she had arrived at the town when she ran straight into an armored pony standing at the edge of the buildings. <text:s/>Too his surprise he stumbled back at little when Wild had run into him. <text:s/>After shifting her attention back to her pony self from the tree Wild apologized, “Sorry, I am not seeing you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">“Uh, that&apos;s alright little filly, but what are you doing out here?” <text:s/>the guard said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">“Coming back.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">“And where are you parents?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">“Dead.” <text:s/>The guards ears folded down at that and his eyes widened. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">Shit, I am not good at talking to normal people, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">she panic. “Do not be sad. <text:s/>It happened long time ago.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“Well, I can take you back to the orphanage. <text:s/>It&apos;s not safe out here, a monster was seen yesterday.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“No, no orphanage. <text:s/>I fine.” <text:s/>she blurted and looked around, “I do not see monster.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“It left for now, but it could come back. <text:s/>You need to get inside for safety.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“No worry. <text:s/>I can take it.” <text:s/>Wild said and pantomimed punching. <text:s/>She tried to walk away, but the guard grabbed her. <text:s/>She kept at it dragging the guard along behind her until he simply picked her up. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">Right, I&apos;m a child, can&apos;t just take care of myself, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">she huffed to herself and frowned as she was held off the ground. <text:s/>The guard opened his wings and took off with some difficulty. <text:s/>It was not long before the two made it into the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T252">office of the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">local orphanage.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197"><text:span text:style-name="T70">The room was a simple office. <text:s/>It had wooden floors and white framed, light green walls with a desk in the center. <text:s/>A single window lit the room and a couple potted shrubs provided decoration. <text:s/>The matron sitting behind the desk had the same green coat as Wild Way, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T252">and a rosy pink mane done up in a simple bun</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T252">Good morning ma&apos;am, this little filly wouldn&apos;t happen to be one of yours would she?” the guard asked. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“<text:span text:style-name="T364">No, she&apos;s not from here. <text:s/>Where did you find her?” the matron asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“<text:span text:style-name="T364">She just wandered in from the Everfree forest.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“<text:span text:style-name="T364">The Everfree.” <text:s/>the matron repeated before addressing Wild, “What in the world were you doing in there, child?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3">“<text:span text:style-name="T364">Exploring.” Wild exclaimed. <text:s/>The other ponies gasped at that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T365">That is extremely dangerous, that forest is full of monsters. <text:s/>You shouldn&apos;t go into it.” <text:s/>the matron said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T366">Really, I not see monsters.” Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T366">You got lucky then. <text:s/>Thank you for bringing her here.” the matron said allowing the guard to return to his post. <text:s/>She leaned forward to peer at Wild as she said, “Now you are an interesting child. <text:s/>I can tell that you aren&apos;t a pony, so don&apos;t feel like you need to hide it.” <text:s/>She stood up and came around to the other side of the desk. <text:s/>She stood a full head taller than any of the other ponies Wild had seen.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T367">Why think that?” Wild asked somewhat concerned that she had a serious problem with her new form.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P188">“<text:span text:style-name="T367">I am not a pony either and happen to be able to sense emotions. <text:s/>Normally ponies radiate emotional energy, but you aren&apos;t. <text:s/>But first, I am Rose Garden the matron for this orphanage why don&apos;t you tell me about yourself.” <text:s/>Rose requested and laid down to be at the same level as Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P188">“<text:span text:style-name="T368">I am Wild Way a... uh... we do not have name. <text:s/>Blacklight is close enough.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P188">“<text:span text:style-name="T368">I have never heard of Blacklight.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P188">“<text:span text:style-name="T368">Good. <text:s/>Only one other. <text:s/>He is terrible.” <text:s/>Wild snarled with a deep basso rumble.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P198">Rose pulled back at that as her hackles rose and said, “<text:span text:style-name="T369">Right, well a new topic, how old are you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P198">“<text:span text:style-name="T369">19”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P198">“<text:span text:style-name="T369">Well, that&apos;s good most of the little ones here are around your age.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P198">“<text:span text:style-name="T369">What? <text:s/>I am adult.” blurted Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P198">“<text:span text:style-name="T369">Oh, interesting. <text:s/>Ponies must age slower than you, 19 years old is still before puberty.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199">Wild opened her mouth to reply, but hesitated as she considered Rose&apos;s words. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">I am the age of a child here, that might not be such a bad thing, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">Wild realized, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">Hell, I&apos;ve been living alone in an apocalypse. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">“Can I just be a child then?” Wild pleaded with wide eyes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“The eyes don&apos;t work on me, but yes, you can be one of the children here. <text:s/>I suppose you aren&apos;t looking to be adopted.” Rose asked and received a nod, “Usually, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T253">its the older kids that go that route, but I guess you are a special case.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“You said you were not a pony, so what are you?” <text:s/>Wild asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“Ah, I did say that. <text:s/>I&apos;m a changeling, a shape shifter.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“I can shape shift, am I a changeling?” Wild posed with a head tilt.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“Changelings are also emotivores, we eat emotions, and look like bug ponies in our base form.” <text:s/>Rose explained. <text:s/>A bolt of fear ran down Wilds spine at the mention of bug ponies.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“Um, could you show me?” Wild gulped as she twiddled her hooves. <text:s/>Rose noticed the change, and decided to see where this was going. <text:s/>She got up and locked the door, made sure the window was </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T253">covered, and returned to the center of the room. <text:s/>Pink flames erupted over her body before immediately <text:s/>dissipating and revealing Rose&apos;s changeling form. <text:s/>She looked much like the creature from the forest with chitin and pink shell, but she also had a full mane of pink hair. <text:s/>Just behind her horn was a trio of antennae that resembled a small crown, and pink bands circled her torso. <text:s/>She was also taller in this form standing nearly two meters tall not counting her horn. <text:s/>Wild did not notice any of this as she had jumped away the instant the flames appeared. <text:s/>Rose was confused by the disappearance of Wild until she dropped down from the ceiling.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“Of course it had to be fire.” Wild muttered under her breath as she calmed down. <text:s/>No longer panicking, she inspected Rose&apos;s new form and confirmed her fear.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“Are you alright, dear. <text:s/>I can change back if you need.” <text:s/>Rose offered seeing the state of Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“No. No.” <text:s/>Wild pleaded, “I&apos;m just a little afraid of fire. <text:s/>I think you look pretty.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“Thank you, there aren&apos;t many who would consider a changeling pretty, but there is something more bothering you.” <text:s/>said Rose once again laying down, but as a changeling this time.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“When I was in the Everfree forest I found a body that looked like you.” <text:s/>Wild said looking down at the floor and away from Rose.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“Oh” Rose whispered, “You found Garnet. <text:s/>That can&apos;t have been a pleasant experience. <text:s/>I&apos;m sorry you had to see that.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“Um, I&apos;m very used to death. <text:s/>I hope you won&apos;t be mad, but she was mostly eaten by the roc. <text:s/>I finished what it started” Wild confessed and prayed for the best. <text:s/>Rose didn&apos;t react immediately as she tried to process that statement.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“You ate her.” <text:s/>Rose intone, a few tears falling from her eyes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“Merged would be more accurate.” Wild said, “I was hoping that I could recover something from her. <text:s/>That&apos;s how I learned to speak this language.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T253">“I knew she wouldn&apos;t be coming back when that damn roc took her. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t think anyone would be able to find her body.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T254">Rose sniffed and pulled Wild into an embrace. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s true or not, but its like a small piece of her came back. <text:s/>That&apos;s more than I could have expected.” <text:s/>Wild returned the hug after her shock at Rose&apos;s reaction faded. <text:s/>The two of them just sat there as Rose worked the tears out of her system.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T254">“I thought you would be mad.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T254">“Maybe a century ago, but I find its better to look for the positive side. <text:s/>You gave her a chance to help you even in death.” Rose said letting Wild out of the embrace. <text:s/>“Also, the roc was the one to kill her, that is where my anger is directed.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T254">“It tried to eat me too.” <text:s/>Wild grumbled, “Stupid bird, that was the last mistake it made.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T254">“I hope you&apos;re not planning to kill everything that makes you mad.” Rose said and poked Wild for emphasis.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T254">“No, but if something tries to eat me, I plan to return the favor.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T254">“Fair enough I suppose. <text:s/>You should keep that kind of thing to yourself around town though. <text:s/>Ponies aren&apos;t as accepting of predatory behavior. <text:s/>Speaking of that, you can clearly eat meat but what about plants?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199"><text:span text:style-name="T254">“I can eat just about anything. <text:s/>I usually </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T255">just </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T254">eat trash since no one really minds if it goes missing.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Rose rubbed her head with a hoof at that. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T255">That won&apos;t be necessary anymore.” she said before </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">decid</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T255">ing</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"> it was time to introduce Wild Way to the others, but she needed to transform again. <text:s/>Wild closed her eyes and was able to resist the desire to flee. <text:s/>Now ready the two exited the office and went into the main room of the orphanage. <text:s/>It was essentially giant living room. <text:s/>Toys were strewn across </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T255">a carpeted floor. <text:s/>Plenty of windows made it feel very open and bright. <text:s/>Chairs and a couch were placed along the walls and 5 ponies were positioned around a board game.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200"><text:span text:style-name="T255">“Good morning everypony.” <text:s/>Rose said getting the attention of everyone in the room. “We have a new addition today. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T256">Go ahead and introduce yourself, dear.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T255">”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200"><text:span text:style-name="T255">“Hi, I&apos;m Wild Way.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T256">Wild proclaimed to the others. <text:s/>“I like to explore things.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T257">The rest of the ponies also introduced themselves. <text:s/>Aura was an earth filly with a lavender coat and turquoise mane. <text:s/>The unicorn filly with a</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T258">n orange</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T257"> coat and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T258">goldenrod</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T257"> mane was </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T258">Amber Gem</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T257">. <text:s/>The earth colt with a cobalt coat and light blue mane was Cobalt. <text:s/>Little Road was the unicorn colt with a brown coat and light gray mane. <text:s/>Finally, Citrine was a worker at the orphanage. <text:s/>She was unicorn with a yellow coat, and pale blue mane. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T258">All of the children looked about Wild&apos;s age, except for Amber Gem who looked to be almost an adult.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P201"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Wild was quickly </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T258">invited</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T258">to join them in the</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"> board game </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T259">and Rose left to see to her own tasks</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">. <text:s/>Normally the children would be outside </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T258">playing but the attack yesterday caused most to stay indoors when possible. <text:s/>When wild looked at the game board she made a discovery. <text:s/>“I completely forgot about learning to read and write Equish.” Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P201"><text:span text:style-name="T258">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T259">You can&apos;t read?” asked </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">Amber Gem.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P201"><text:span text:style-name="T260">“The city I lived in had a different language. <text:s/>I only just learned to speak Equish, now I need to learn to read it.” Wild answered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P201"><text:span text:style-name="T260">“Well, we do have some </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261">books to teach reading.” <text:s/>Citrine said and levitated a few books over to Wild. <text:s/>As they floated in front of her Wild tilted her head back and forth before cautiously poking one of the books. <text:s/>“Is something wrong?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P201"><text:span text:style-name="T261">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T262">They&apos;re floating.” Wild said with her face crewed up in concentration.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202"><text:span text:style-name="T262">“It&apos;s just levitation, every unicorn can use it.” Citrine offered as an explanation.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202"><text:span text:style-name="T262">Wild searched through her memories for an explanation. <text:s/>“Magic. <text:s/>Magic is real here.” she exulted look at Citrine with wide eyes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202"><text:span text:style-name="T262">“Yes... </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T263">There&apos;s </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T262">Magic everywhere in the world.” <text:s/>Citrine </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T263">said with a quirked eyebrow, “How is this </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T263">the first time that you have seen it?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203"><text:span text:style-name="T263">W</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">ild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T281">blink</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"> before answering, “Oh, I did forget to mention... Uh, well, you see I&apos;m not from this world.” <text:s/>She was met by a wall of blank stares.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“Pfft. <text:s/>No way you&apos;re an alien.” Cobalt said as the first to speak.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“Did you come to suck out our brains?” <text:s/>Little Road asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“That&apos;s zombies, stupid. <text:s/>She came for the cows.” <text:s/>Aura said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“Calm down, children. <text:s/>And don&apos;t all others stupid, Aura.” <text:s/>Citrine commanded. <text:s/>Aura apologized to Little Road. <text:s/>“Now, what do you mean by not from this world, Wild?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T264">I was taken from another world by Gaea. <text:s/>I don&apos;t really know who she is, or why she did it, but I didn&apos;t have anything left in my world and this one is much nicer.” <text:s/>Wild answered with a shrug.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203"><text:span text:style-name="T264">“So, no spaceship then?” Little Road asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203"><text:span text:style-name="T264">“Sorry, but no.” <text:s/>Wild answered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203"><text:span text:style-name="T264">“Well, everypony this is something that we need to keep secret from the rest of the town.” <text:s/>Citrine said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P204"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Wild shifted her eyes away from the group and said, “That won&apos;t work. <text:s/>Uh, you see, I&apos;m kinda forced to answer questions truthfully.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P204"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“You&apos;re under a geas! <text:s/>You poor thing!” <text:s/>Citrine shouted as she pulled Wild into a hug.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P204"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“If brain washing counts as whatever a geas is then yes.” <text:s/>Wild said and returned the hug. <text:s/>Citrine blanched when she heard that response, but Wild did not notice. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve had a hug in the past year.” <text:s/>Wild smiled before quickly adding, “Can we change topics, this one does not lead anywhere nice.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P204"><text:span text:style-name="T70">The kids were fine with returning to their board game. <text:s/>Citrine was the only one to understand the scope of what she heard. <text:s/>Wild got to work on learning to read with the books that Citrine at selected. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T265">She would only look at each page for a few seconds before turning to the next one. <text:s/>When she finished the material she found that everyone was looking at her. <text:s/>“What?” she asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P204"><text:span text:style-name="T265">“Did you actually read any of those pages?” <text:s/>Citrine asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P204"><text:span text:style-name="T265">“Oh, yes. <text:s/>My whole body acts a brain. <text:s/>It doesn&apos;t make a difference most of the time, but I can read and learn things very quickly.” <text:s/>Wild answered. <text:s/>Now armed with the ability to read Wild joined in with the others. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T266">Lunch came and went, and they all found things to entertain themselves with during the afternoon. <text:s/>That lasted until Wild suddenly looked out the window and walked over to it. <text:s/>In response <text:s/>to the others curiosity she said, “I just realized that rocs travel in pairs.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205"><text:span text:style-name="T70">The mate of the first roc was flying near Wild&apos;s tree body when it let out a call claiming the nearby territory. <text:s/>Wild could not let that go unchallenged and rearranged her tree to effectively make it a giant sub-woofer. <text:s/>She also recreated her human body at the top of the tree to watch the roc more closely. <text:s/></text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T70">Now ready she returned the call with a growl lowered in pitch and with as much volume as she could get. <text:s/>The roc&apos;s call could be heard in Ponyville causing the ponies to stop and try to locate the source. <text:s/>Wild&apos;s call could be felt throughout the town and persuaded them that they wanted to be inside now.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205"><text:span text:style-name="T70">The children had joined pony Wild at the window and ducked at the second call, but popped back up <text:s/>when Wild did not even react to it. <text:s/>Citrine and even Rose had joined them at the window to see what was going on. <text:s/>In response the roc had started to circle back into the forest passing near the town.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“What in the world is going on out there!” Rose asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“A giant monster battle.” <text:s/>Cobalt cheered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T267">Should we </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T268">really</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T267"> be at the window?” asked Amber Gem.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205"><text:span text:style-name="T267">“Eh, looks like the fight will be in the forest.” Wild answered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205"><text:span text:style-name="T267">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T268">Mama Rose, what kind of animal made that noise?” Aura asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205"><text:span text:style-name="T268">“I don&apos;t know, Aura, but I do have a suspicion.” <text:s/>Rose replied and placed a hoof on Wilds withers. <text:s/>Before Wild could respond, a crossbow bolt impacted the roc causing it to cry out and list toward the town. <text:s/>Wild&apos;s human body took off for the edge of the forest to get closer to the new location of the fight.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P206"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Wild&apos;s ears shot up and eyes widened as everyone looked at her. “Uh... What suspicion is that?” she asked and the attention turned back to Rose.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P206"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“Well, If it&apos;s not anything that lives around here, then maybe it&apos;s some kind of alien creature.” <text:s/>Rose said and peered down at Wild with the others.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P206"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“That make</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T269">s</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"> sense. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T269">W</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">hat would you say to such a creature?” <text:s/>Wild asked and the eyes went back to Rose. <text:s/>Outside, the roc was over the border to Ponyville and scores of magic blasts where flying through the air. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T269">Many of the bolts landed but did not do any serious damage to the bird.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P206"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T269">I would tell you to be careful. <text:s/>You might attract more attention than you can handle.” <text:s/>Rose </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T270">said. <text:s/>Wild had just positioned her human body in one of the trees along edge of the forest. <text:s/>The roc was swooping down toward a formation of 20-30 armored ponies. <text:s/>The bolts continued to fire up until the roc started flying back up with one of the guards in its talons. <text:s/>The ranks had completely falling apart with guards scattered around the area all staring at the bird as it flew over the town.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P207"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Amid gasps Wild asked, “I don&apos;t suppose the guards can safely catch him?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P207"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“What do you--” <text:s/>Citrine started before the roc came back into view of the window and her eyes widened.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P207"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“No, they would need to have pegasi in the air to catch him.” <text:s/>Rose answered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P207"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“Why don&apos;t they have air support.” <text:s/>Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T271">asked</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"> and saw the abducted pony start falling. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T271">She had also noticed a second bolt impact the roc&apos;s wing.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"> <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T271">Alright, my turn.” <text:s/>Wild&apos;s human body jumped off of the tree and ran to the falling pony. <text:s/>She jumped, caught him at the apex, and wrapped her arms </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T271">underneath him. <text:s/>The two fell toward the ground and Wild prepared to absorb the landing. <text:s/>Her legs hit <text:s/>the ground and folded despite her efforts. <text:s/>She ended up in kneeling position sunk a centimeter into the dirt. <text:s/>The pony rolled out of her arms and impacted the ground with a solid thud. <text:s/>She was not able to absorb the full impact, but it was no longer fatal. <text:s/>A cursory inspection of the guard and Wild said, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T272">Yeah, y</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T271">ou&apos;re going to feel that in morning.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P208"><text:span text:style-name="T271">W</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">ild stood back up loudly popping her joints back together. <text:s/>All of the nearby ponies cringed at the noises while switching between watching Wild and roc. <text:s/>Wild, however, was calmly looking around for a projectile keeping track of the roc circling above with sonar. <text:s/>She found a baseball sized stone and stood back up with it. <text:s/>Motion in the corner of her eye gave her just enough warning to raise her hand into the path of another bolt. <text:s/>She looked at the bolt sticking out of her palm before plucking it out and licking the tip. <text:s/>She threw it aside and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T273">chuckled</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T273">A muscle relaxant? <text:s/>What, are there assassin ponies now?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P209"><text:span text:style-name="T70">The wound on her hand was already healed as she to a pitchers stance. <text:s/>Winding up a throw she aimed for the roc and launched the rock. <text:s/>The rock impacted the bird&apos;s chest causing it to let out a cry of alarm. <text:s/>That was the first attack to actually cause it pain in longer than the roc could remember. <text:s/>The roc fled as the hunting ground had become far more dangerous than it expected.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P209"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Wild started to walk back into the forest before the guard she caught called to her, “Hey, Thanks for saving my life.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P210"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Wild stopped and blinked for a moment, before replying, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T274">Uh, y</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">our welcome.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T274">The forth bolt struck Wild in the stomach going about halfway in. <text:s/>The pony blanched at that, but she just yanked it out and dropped it. <text:s/>“Oh, that second animal call was mine, so you don&apos;t need to worry about it.” <text:s/>Wild said as she walked into the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Once far enough away she converted another tree and merged her human body with it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P211"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Back with her pony body everyone was silent before Cobalt cheered, “Yeah, that was awesome.” <text:s/>That opened the flood gates and the rest of the children joined in talking about what they just saw. <text:s/>Luckily, they looked at it like a movie and glossed over the fact that someone almost died.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P211"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“Those crossbow bolts were poisoned.” <text:s/>Wild said turning to face Rose, “The guards don&apos;t use poison do they?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P211"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“That&apos;s the weapon of an assassin. <text:s/>A very reckless one at that.” <text:s/>Rose said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P211"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“At least he was just shooting at me.” <text:s/>Wild said as the two silently considered the new developments.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P211"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Amber Gem came up to Wild and asked, “Was that really you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P211"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“Yes, thats what I looked like originally. <text:s/>Well I wasn&apos;t that athletic, but its pretty close.” <text:s/>Wild answered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P211"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“How can you be in two places at once?” <text:s/>Amber Gem asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P211"><text:span text:style-name="T70">“My mind covers my entire body no matter how far away some parts may be. <text:s/>I can even split </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T70">myself into as many pieces as I want.” <text:s/>Wild answered, “Controlling them is another matter. <text:s/>I can&apos;t figure out how to use more than one at a time.” <text:s/>Wild was quickly drawn into a question and answer session as the other ponies started with their own questions.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P101" text:outline-level="1"><text:span text:style-name="T106">C</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">hapter 3</text:span></text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">The injured guard was helped to the hospital as one leg was at least severely sprained. <text:s/>The rest of the guards went about setting up a camp between the town and the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Watching the construction was a popular activity among the children even getting an occasional wave from the guards. <text:s/>Soon night came and Wild got to experience another forgotten indulgence from before Blacklight: a proper bed. <text:s/>There were few enough foals that each got their own small bedroom on the second floor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">She could not get to sleep yet as she had some preparations to make. <text:s/>She fully intended to live in Ponyville and did not like the possibility of mega-fauna trying to make it their hunting grounds. <text:s/>The obvious solution to her was to become a larger predator and claim Ponyville as her territory. <text:s/>Starting at the edge of the forest as her human self she began taking over the trees. <text:s/>She gradually made her way deeper into the forest until she was half a kilometer deep. <text:s/>In order to make her claim known she needed to give the trees a predator&apos;s scent. <text:s/>She went with a faint human scent so it would be unique for this world and unnoticeable to the ponies. <text:s/>Giving the trees the ability to use sonar and hear was the last task before she got to sleep for the rest of the night.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">Morning came and breakfast shortly followed. <text:s/>Wild noticed something that she overlooked yesterday. <text:s/>The ponies were holding spoons with their hooves. <text:s/>She asked, “How do you hold a spoon?” <text:s/>After a round of confused response she clarified, “How can you grip things with a hoof?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">“Magic.” Aura replied.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">“There&apos;s hoof magic?” Wild wondered as she repeatedly put a hoof on her spoon trying to lift it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">“Everypony can use their magic to attach things to their hoof, kind of like a magnet.” Citrine said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">“So since I have no magic I&apos;m just going to have to stick with suction.” <text:s/>Wild said as she finally lifted her spoon and got a scoop of cereal. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T370">When she looked up everyone was staring at her. <text:s/>“What?” she asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">“<text:span text:style-name="T371">All living things have magic!” Amber said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">“<text:span text:style-name="T371">Not any more, the world I came from didn&apos;t have magic. <text:s/>Even being a pony does give me any magic so I doubt I will ever get any.” <text:s/>Wild shrugged.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">“<text:span text:style-name="T371">But all those things you do. <text:s/>That has to be magic.” <text:s/>Little Road said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">“<text:span text:style-name="T371">All of that is just the ability to control every cell individually.” Wild said causing Rose to start coughing.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158">“<text:span text:style-name="T371">The amount control that would take is absurd.” <text:s/>Rose said, “The possibilities are... terrifying.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T371">More than can imagine. <text:s/>That&apos;s what happened to the city I lived in.” <text:s/>Wild said while looking down at the table. <text:s/>She looked back up to ask, “Where do ponies get magic from, it can&apos;t be anything biological or I could copy that?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159">Rose had blanched as she considered the implication of Wild&apos;s words so Citrine answered, “The soul. <text:s/>Everypony receives a tiny piece of their parents soul before they are born. <text:s/>Those pieces combine and <text:span text:style-name="T381">sowly</text:span> grow into a full soul.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159">“If Wild doesn&apos;t have a soul, then how will she get into Elysium.” <text:s/>Aura asked tears already forming in her eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159">“I&apos;m practically <text:span text:style-name="T381">unkillable</text:span> so it will be fine.” <text:s/>She answered after a quick explanation of Elysium, the pony analogue of heaven. <text:s/>She also mumbled, “Not that I could make it <text:span text:style-name="T381">even if I had</text:span> a soul.” <text:s/>Aura nodded and went back to her cereal. <text:s/>Breakfast went smoothly from there, but Rose had Wild stay behind.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159">“I&apos;m concerned about the implications of what you said.” <text:s/>Rose said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159">“That&apos;s fair, but the reality is probably worse than you imagine.” <text:s/>Wild answered and looked rose in the eyes, “Might as well get this out of the way. <text:s/>I am an unrepentant sadistic mass murderer. <text:s/>The only redeeming quality is that I only target worse monsters than me.” <text:s/>A moment of thought and she added, “And anything that tries to eat me alive. <text:s/>Something of a pet peeve that happens more often than you might think.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159">Rose just sat there for a while before speaking. <text:s/>“<text:span text:style-name="T372">You are just a walking contradiction. <text:s/>Yesterday you saved that guard, now you tell me you&apos;re a monster.” Rose said resting her chin in a hoof.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159">“<text:span text:style-name="T372">I guess it would be more accurate to say I have a nasty temper and no real taboos. <text:s/>Although not much can actually get me angry. <text:s/>As for saving the guard...” <text:s/>Wild said and looked around before leaning in to whisper, “ponies are adorable.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P160">Rose <text:span text:style-name="T381">blinked before </text:span>chuckl<text:span text:style-name="T381">ing</text:span>, “I suppose that&apos;s as good a reason as any.” <text:s/>She went on to say, <text:s/>“Now, I can&apos;t figure out what kind of creature you are. <text:s/>From what you said it sounds like you&apos;re some kind of spirit possessing that body, but without magic.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P160">“I never thought about it that way. <text:s/>Technically I&apos;m not a creature, and everything I know says it shouldn&apos;t be possible for me to be sapient. <text:s/>I&apos;m actually a viral strain that had the mind of a teenage girl imprinted on it.” <text:s/>Wild said causing Rose to recoil.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P160">“<text:span text:style-name="T381">A</text:span> disease!” <text:span text:style-name="T373">Rose gasped. <text:s/>Wild could hear some hooves moving to the other side of the door.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P160">“<text:span text:style-name="T373">Not just a disease, a weapon of mass destruction that makes zombies. <text:s/>I think the zombies were accidental though. <text:s/>I do know that they never intended for someone to retain their mind and gain control of it.” <text:s/>Wild said. <text:s/>“For obvious reason I do not intend to let any of it leave my control.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P160">“<text:span text:style-name="T373">You survived a zombie apocalypse.” <text:s/>Rose said and put a foreleg around Wild, “Dear child, I can&apos;t even begin to imagine what you&apos;ve experienced.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P161"><text:soft-page-break/>Wild gave a humorless chuckle, “A zombie apocalypse happened and then my life started going downhill and didn&apos;t stop till now. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t really survive though, I just got an extra life for better or worse.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P161">Cobalt could be heard from the door saying, “...she&apos;s an alien zombie ninja. <text:s/>So cool.” <text:s/>Wild snorted an started laughing at that.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P161">“I&apos;ve never been described as a alien zombie ninja before.” Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P161">“That&apos;s totally what you are.” <text:s/>Cobalt replied.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P161">“We&apos;re supposed to be quiet so they don&apos;t notice us.” Aura scolded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P161">“Oh yeah... Oops”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P161">“Bless his little heart, but that colt <text:span text:style-name="T374">can be so oblivious</text:span>.” Rose muttered with a smile. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T374">The pair went back into the main room with the others. <text:s/>Cobalt was convinced that only ninjas could jump and catch a pony in the air, so Wild was permanently an alien zombie ninja in his mind. <text:s/>Wild watched as some of the guard ponies started wandering around her forest. <text:s/>They kept quiet though so she could not tell what they were after. <text:s/>When it was near lunch time Aura had a realization.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P161">“<text:span text:style-name="T374">We have to go to Sugarcube Corner. <text:s/>Pinkie hasn&apos;t met Wild yet.” <text:s/>she gasped.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P162">Citrine sighed, “I suppose delaying that would only make it worse.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P162">“Who&apos;s Pinkie?” <text:s/>Wild asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P162">“The welcome wagon. <text:s/>Literally. <text:s/>She actually has a wagon she uses to greet new ponies in town.” <text:s/>Citrine answered, “She has the best intentions but no concept of personal space.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P162">“And she eats a bag of sugar for breakfast every morning.” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T375">Little Road added.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P163">Wild was about to say that that would cause diabetes, but realized she had no idea how pony metabolism worked. <text:s/>She decided to test it and flooded her body with glucose and speed up the biochemistry to see what would happen. <text:s/>To her surprise not only did she see no sign of diabetes, but she lost track of the energy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P163">“Huh, I guess ponies are just immune to diabetes. <text:s/>Weird.” she commented and noticed that everyone was staring at her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P163">“You&apos;re sparkling.” Aura said causing Wild to inspect her body. <text:s/>Just as Aura said white sparkles were rising out of her body and slowly dissipating in the air.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P163">“So that&apos;s where the energy went. <text:s/>It made sparkles.” <text:s/>Wild said and scratched her head. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P163">Citrine lit her horn and all of the sparkles started flying to her disappearing when they reached her horn. <text:s/>“You&apos;re radiating raw magic.” <text:s/>she said with furrowed brows. <text:s/>“How did you do that?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P163">“I just raised my blood sugar level. <text:s/>I guess thats just a thing that pony fat does.” <text:s/>Wild shrugged. <text:s/>That little nugget of wisdom imparted the group was ready to head out. <text:s/>Rose stayed behind as Citrine <text:soft-page-break/>took the rest to Sugarcube Corner. <text:s/>The bakery stood out from the rest of the town as it was decorated as a giant gingerbread house. <text:s/>Wild promptly walked up and licked the side of the building. <text:s/>“Definitely not gingerbread.” <text:s/>she said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P163">“<text:span text:style-name="T376">You didn&apos;t have to lick it.” <text:s/>Citrine said while rubbing her head. <text:s/>The others just giggled as they filed into the building with Wild taking up the rear.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P163">“<text:span text:style-name="T376">Hello, Citrine. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t expect--” gasped someone from inside. <text:s/>Wild only made it one step into the building before her entire vision turned pink.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P163">“<text:span text:style-name="T376">I&apos;m being attacked by the color pink.” <text:s/>Wild mumbled from inside a fuzzy bear hug. <text:s/>Any other pony would have had a problem trying to breath, but she just wiggled a bit before deciding to wait it out. <text:s/>Soon enough the hug ended and she was released to see an earth mare that was the incarnation of pink. <text:s/>Her fur was pink, her mane looked like pink cotton candy, but her eyes were blue. <text:s/>She had a cutie mark of three balloons and an enormous smile.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P163">“<text:span text:style-name="T376">Citrine, you didn&apos;t tell me you got a new foal. <text:s/>Wait, my Pinkie sense didn&apos;t tell me either.” <text:s/>Pinkie babbled as she carefully examined Wild and rubbed her chin. <text:s/>Wild in response lifted a hoof and placed on the pink mares snoot. <text:s/>The mare giggled, “Ah, now I remember you. <text:s/>Here try a strawberry cupcake.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P164">Wild took a moment to process the mares words while holding the cupcake. <text:s/>“Huh, you&apos;re right we did meet before, but how in the world did you recognize me?” she asked. <text:s/>Unable to resist she bit into the cupcake straight through the paper and no longer cared about anything else.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P164">“...You&apos;re supposed to take the paper off.” <text:s/>Citrine said but got no response, “I think she likes strawberry cupcakes. <text:s/>Although, where did you meet her, Pinkie?” <text:s/>The other kids had glued themselves to the display as the two mares walked over.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P164">“<text:span text:style-name="T377">Oh, she was at the party when Princess Luna was here. <text:s/>Now, what can Pinkie do for you?” <text:s/>Pinkie said. <text:s/>Wild had appeared at the display too. <text:s/>When they all placed their orders, she predictably asked for more strawberries in the form of a milk shake. <text:s/>The group found a seat and dug into their treats. <text:s/>As they finished, each of the ponies went off to play on their own. <text:s/>However, Aura decided to take Wild on a tour of the town.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P165">They went to a lot of the same places that Wild had gone to as a cat, but this time she could find out what they were. <text:s/>Ironically that tree with a door in it was the town&apos;s library. <text:s/>There was a building shaped like a carousel that sold clothing. <text:s/>A confusing choice to Wild since she had yet to see any <text:s/>the ponies wearing anything other than saddlebags. <text:s/>They visited the schoolhouse, passed by the train station, saw the theater, and finished at the apple orchard on the edge of town.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P165">“There&apos;s so many apple trees.” <text:s/>Wild gawked as she leaned over the small wooden fence around the orchard.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P165">“Of course there are silly.” <text:s/>Aura laughed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P165">A blond maned orange mare came up from the other side of the fence. <text:s/>She had three apples on her <text:soft-page-break/>flank and a stetson hat on her head. <text:s/>“Howdy, Aura, who&apos;s your friend?” <text:s/>she asked. <text:s/>Hearing the new pony Wild walked up next to Aura.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P165">“Hi Applejack, this is Wild Way the new filly.” <text:s/>Aura chirped.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P165">“Hello miss” <text:s/>Wild said but Applejack&apos;s expression darkened.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P165">“That&apos;s an odd eye color you got there.” <text:s/>Applejack said with narrowed eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P165">“Really. <text:s/>That&apos;s the color they&apos;ve always been.” <text:s/>Wild replied with a quirked head while Aura looked between the other two with pulled back ears.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P165">“<text:span text:style-name="T378">Is something wrong?” <text:s/>Aura asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">Applejack took a second to respond, “No, No problem. <text:s/>Just... never seen that eye color. <text:s/>Sorry girls, but I gotta get back to work.” <text:s/>With that she went back into the orchard at a slightly faster rate than needed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">“I think she might be worse than me at lying.” <text:s/>Wild said while they watched Applejack&apos;s retreating form.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">“Yeah, the apples are known for honesty. <text:s/>They still lie like anypony, but none of them could tell a convincing lie to save their lives.” <text:s/>Aura said as the two began heading back to the town proper. <text:s/>“Hey, um, I was just wondering... how does your truth thingy work?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">Wild chewed on her lip before answering, “I guess I never did explain it in detail. <text:s/>There are actually multiple punishments and each time I break one of the &apos;rules&apos; I get put into the next one. <text:s/>I fall back to the previous one after a set amount of time. <text:s/>While each punishment is shorter than the last its much worse, so I learned quickly to avoid them at all costs. <text:s/>They are also why I&apos;m afraid of fire. <text:s/>The first punishment is a warning, It feels like sitting in front of a bonfire. <text:s/>The laters ones follow the same theme, but I would rather not go into detail. <text:s/>Blackwatch actually used the fact that I have perfect recall so I can literally feel the heat and hear the crackling.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">“You don&apos;t have to tell me if you don&apos;t want.” <text:s/>Aura offered seeing the effect on Wild. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">Wild wiped at the tears collecting from her eyes and stared at them. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">I haven&apos;t actually cried in so long, </text:span>she thought, <text:span text:style-name="T13">couldn&apos;t really afford to. <text:s/></text:span>“No, trying to avoid it wouldn&apos;t help, and the worst part is out of the way.” <text:s/>she countered before continuing her explanation, “There are actually two rules I have to follow. <text:s/>The first is simple enough, I can&apos;t knowingly tell a falsehood. <text:s/>I can be as misleading as I want, though. <text:s/>They never did fix that loophole. <text:s/>The second is a problem though. <text:s/>I can&apos;t leave a question unanswered. <text:s/>That means I have to give a response that the other person can hear and that they are satisfied and move on to the next topic. <text:s/>There&apos;s not really a good definition of &apos;being satisfied&apos; but repeating the same question will always trigger it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">“Wait, just anypony could do that? <text:s/>What if they just repeat their question just to be mean?” <text:s/>Aura asked already suspecting the answer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">Wild checked the streets and saw they were empty before answering, “Yep, it was never meant to be <text:soft-page-break/>a nice thing. <text:s/>You probably already know the answer, but each repetition will increase the punishment regardless of why it was repeated.” <text:s text:c="3"/>Another check to make sure the streets were still empty and she continued, “I have gone through it many times just because someone felt like it, so please don&apos;t share this information with anyone. <text:s/>Well, I guess Rose and Citrine are fine. <text:s/>There is one nice thing, answering a question reduces the punishment, so a few simple ones like &apos;What color is the sky?&apos; can stop it completely.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">“Wow, that sucks. <text:s/>I promise I won&apos;t tell anypony though.” <text:s/>Aura consoled. <text:s/>Soon they were at the door to Sugarcube Corner though Wild didn&apos;t know why. <text:s/>When they entered the lights were off, but Wild could still clearly see and hear all of the ponies in the room. <text:s/>She had no idea what they were doing though.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">“SURPRISE!” <text:s/>the ponies yelled as they jumped out of there hiding spots, and the lights turned on. <text:s/>Wild&apos;s ears folded back and she just blinked at the ponies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">“It&apos;s a surprise party for you.” <text:s/>Pinkie said after popping up in front of Wild, “I couldn&apos;t throw one for you when you first arrived because there was already a party. <text:s/>That&apos;s why I had to throw one today to welcome you to the town. <text:s/>So, were you surprised?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">Now understanding what going on Wild looked around at all of the ponies mingling and started to smile. <text:s/>“Yeah, I was surprised. <text:s/>Nobody&apos;s thrown me a surprise party before.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">“Well, that changes today.” <text:s/>Aura said and dragged Wild into the party. <text:s/>The<text:span text:style-name="T379">y spent their time talking with various ponies at the party and occasionally raiding the dessert table. <text:s/>Wild was enjoying the party <text:s/>when Applejack and a purple unicorn came up to her. <text:s/>The unicorn had a dark purple mane with a pink stripe in it and a cutie mark of a large star surrounded by five small white stars.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">“<text:span text:style-name="T380">I don&apos;t see what—” the unicorn got out before Wild turned to look at her. <text:s/>She blinked and asked, “...Hello, Wild Way, I&apos;m Twilight Sparkle. <text:s/>Do you...uh, feel alright?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P166">“<text:span text:style-name="T380">Yep, I feel fine. <text:s/>Why?” <text:s/>Wild chirped while Twilight lit up her horn.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“See I told ya. <text:s/>She&apos;s undead.” <text:s/>Applejack whispered to Twilight.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“What&apos;s an undead.” <text:s/>Wild asked causing the mares to give her a wide eyed stare, “I have ears.” <text:s/>Aura found that more entertaining than the either of the mares.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Magically animated bodies but those are just fiction. <text:s/>I&apos;m sure there is a perfectly good reason for your gray eyes.” <text:s/>Twilight said with a forced smile.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“What do gray eyes have to do with anything?” <text:s/>Wild asked with a furrowed brow.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“They&apos;re a sure sign of evil.” <text:s/>Applejack spouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“No, they are a sign of magical exhaustion. <text:s/>Eye and coat color come from a ponies magic, and without magic they become gray.” <text:s/>Twilight explained.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Huh, that&apos;s good to know. <text:s/>I should get them change to some other color.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167"><text:soft-page-break/>“No, that&apos;s not... <text:s/>You should be resting to recover your magic. <text:s/>Although, I don&apos;t understand why your coat isn&apos;t gray too.” <text:s/>Twilight said with a hoof to her face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Well, the coat&apos;s easy to explain. It&apos;s dyed.” <text:s/>Wild informed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Really, what color is it naturally.” <text:s/>Aura asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“You know I never checked, probably gray from what Twilight said.” <text:s/>answered Wild tapping her chin with a hoof.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“What are you four up to?” <text:s/>Rose said as she walked up behind the two foals.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“We&apos;re learning about evil colors.” <text:s/>Aura said. <text:s/>Rose just lifted an eyebrow and shifted her attention to Wild.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Apparently gray eyes are a &apos;sure sign of evil&apos;.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Applejack, there&apos;s no evil involved.” <text:s/>Rose said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“But she&apos;s got gray eyes, and monsters have started coming out of the Everfree forest.” <text:s/>Applejack said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Traveling through actually, their not from the Everfree.” <text:s/>Wild corrected getting everyone to stare at her, “What, I know a lot of biology stuff.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Do I want to know how you found this information?” <text:s/>Rose asked already grimacing in preparation.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Probably not, but I will say this you can get a lot of information from animal droppings.” <text:s/>Wild answered causing most of the ponies pull back in disgust. <text:s/>Aura however just quirked her head.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Back to the topic, how exactly do you thing she is involved with monsters? <text:s/>And what is it that you intend to do about it?” <text:s/>Rose asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“I- I don&apos;t know yet.” Applejack faltered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“To be fair Wild Way is an oddity, miss--” Twilight said prompting an introduction by Rose Garden, “She does not have any magic. <text:s/>I have no idea how she can even move, it should be impossible.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Things always seem impossible until they&apos;re done.” Wild quoted nodding her head. <text:s/>The conversation devolved into a back and forth of vague accusation and synonyms of the word impossible. The two fillies wandered off after that became apparent and returned to the festivities.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“That thing about animal poop had nothing to do with the question did it?” <text:s/>Aura asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P167">“Not even a little bit.” <text:s/>Wild grinned.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_1" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 4</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">That night Wild was awoken by an itch. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T382">Something was actually damaging her and that would have to be rectified</text:span>. <text:s/>She located the source as one of her trees along the border of the forest. <text:s/>There was a <text:soft-page-break/>pony sized creature by that tree so she silently remade her human body in the top of one of the trees. <text:s/>When she opened her eyes she discovered that it was not a pony, but instead a deer that was messing with the tree. <text:s/>The deer had the same build as a pony, but its tail was just a little cotton ball, and it did not have a mane. <text:s/>The deers coat was brown with white freckles that changed to white on the belly. <text:s/>It had a small barrel on its chest with some kind of liquid in it that it was currently pouring on the tree. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">Damn, it must be some kind of magic, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">Audrey thought watching as the liquid bubbled and steamed on the wood, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">I need a better way to handle that. <text:s/>All I can do now is repair the damage.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">Audrey continued watching the deer&apos;s attempts. <text:s/>The liquid was not causing too much damage but she wanted to figure out how it worked. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">No way is that targeted at Blacklight so it must just fix any &apos;damage&apos;. <text:s/>What if I use the generic biomass. <text:s/></text:span>The area treated by the liquid quickly turned black and stopped sizzling. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">Well, its nice that it worked, but biomass takes so much more energy. </text:span>She jumped down, squatted next to the deer and asked, “Whatcha doing?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">“Who are you?” the deer asked and jumped to her hooves.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">“Audrey. <text:s/>What is this stuff?” <text:s/>Audrey replied as she ran a finger along the blackened area of the tree. <text:s/>Now her finger was sizzling while she inspected it. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">Yep, it is some kind of broad spectrum healing magic, </text:span>she confirmed as her finger also turned black and stopped sizzling.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">“You&apos;re that monster the ponies were talking about!” <text:s/>the deer accused</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">“They&apos;re talking about me? <text:s/>Don&apos;t I feel special now.” Audrey said as she turned her attention to the pony trying to sneak up behind her. <text:s/>One of the guards was creeping toward her keeping out of sight and silent. <text:s/>A pretty good effort for most targets, but pointless against sonar. <text:s/>“That does not explain what you were doing?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">“I&apos;m here to remove your taint from this forest.” <text:s/>the deer declared.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">“Doesn&apos;t look like your doing a good job of that.” <text:s/>Audrey said while poking at the blackened section of tree. <text:s/>The guard was within melee now, and started reaching for his weapon. <text:s/>“You don&apos;t need to bother with that, <text:span text:style-name="T384">swords</text:span> can&apos;t actually hurt me.” <text:s/>Audrey called out to the guard. <text:s/>Instead of stopping the guard tried to draw his weapon and stab her as fast as possible. <text:s/>Audrey just jumped over the weapon and landed sitting on the guards back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">“I will see you evil plan thwarted.” <text:s/>the deer said with a glare and opened her neck barrel to attempt to heal other parts of the forest. <text:s/>Audrey rolled her eyes and turned all of the trees within a few meters to biomass. <text:s/>They still held the same shape but were now black including the leaves make the forest dark even with the morning sun rising on the horizon.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">“No you won&apos;t. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T383">T</text:span>here <text:span text:style-name="T383">is no plan here let alone an evil one.</text:span> <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T383">Even if there was one you couldn&apos;t stop me</text:span>.” <text:s/>Audrey said as she dismounted and walked forward to the doe. <text:s/>Audrey stared down at the doe as she reached out to grab the barrel and remove it. <text:s/>She looked at the thing in one hand while the other kept the deer back. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">What am I going to do with this thing?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">“Give that back.” <text:s/>the doe shouted. <text:s/>Locating a distant bush near a tree she threw the barrel into it. <text:s/><text:soft-page-break/>The doe speed off as son as it touched the ground. <text:s/>Audrey was faster though as her tendrils were ready by the time the barrel arrived to draw it underground.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P168">“Now, what are you doing here?” <text:s/>Audrey said to the pony trying to sneak away. <text:s/>She pointed to the sword laying on the ground and said, “Also, you forgot something.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P169">She watched the pony freeze for a second before puffing himself up and marching over to the sword. <text:s text:c="3"/>“The royal guard has been dispatched to get rid of the monsters that have been plaguing this town recently.” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T383">he said levitating his sword at Audrey, “Surrender or we will use force.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P169">“<text:span text:style-name="T383">I&apos;m going to guess that you are a fresh recruit. <text:s/>You&apos;re going to need more than a sword to force me to do anything.” <text:s/>Audrey said and started walking to the camp. <text:s/>The guard&apos;s face turned red as he was forced to follow behind her. <text:s/>She caught the attention of the few guards awake this early in morning. <text:s/>They watched the odd pair go walk between the tents and arrive at the largest one. <text:s/>There were a couple guards at the entrance armed with spears. <text:s/>As Audrey walked up to them they pointed there spears at her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P169">“<text:span text:style-name="T384">Halt creature, you may not enter this tent.” <text:s/>The guard on the left said while holding his ground.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P169">“<text:span text:style-name="T384">Really, but I have a complaint to submit,” <text:s/>she said before turning around and lifting the guard behind her and presenting him to the other two. <text:s/>“This little guy is rude and kind of annoying.” <text:s/>The levitating sword was thrust in Audrey&apos;s back as the guard she was holding up exploded into a stream of expletives. <text:s/>Looking at the tip of the sword nearly poking into the ponies back she said, <text:s/>“I told you swords can&apos;t hurt me, but you didn&apos;t listen and now you&apos;ve gone and almost stabbed yourself.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P170">She placed the guard to the side as the tent guards stared in horror at the sword embedded in her abdomen. <text:s/>Seeing that they were distracted Audrey just moved the spears out of the way and walked in. <text:s/>It took the guards a moment to regain themselves, but she was already inside by then. <text:s/>Inside the tent was a single table with an annotated map of the Everfree forest on it. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T385">Behind that was a gray unicorn stallion with a brown mane. <text:s/>He was large even for the guards and even had a few scars making him an imposing figure for a pony. <text:s/>“As you may be aware, one of your ponies decided to visit and raised an interesting issue. <text:s/>I have already established myself in the nearby forest, and it seems that may be incompatible with your goals. <text:s/>So let&apos;s go ahead and just resolve this now instead of drawing it out.” <text:s/>Audrey said after sitting down opposite of the stallion.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P170">“<text:span text:style-name="T386">You just decided to barge in here like you own the place, and your goal is diplomacy?” <text:s/>the stallion deadpanned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P170">“<text:span text:style-name="T387">Yes.” <text:s/>Audrey said but the stallion was unmoved. <text:s/>She shifted her eyes to a empty patch of the tent and said, “Well, I&apos;m only 19. <text:s/>What do you expect?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P171">The stallion rubbed his temples at that and said, “Great. <text:s/>Well, we are going to relocate all of the dangerous creatures, and that includes you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P171">“<text:span text:style-name="T388">Oh, I want to see how you relocate a roc.” <text:s/>Audrey said before asking, “Why don&apos;t you have any pegasi though?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P171"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T388">Unicorns are perfectly capable of shooting flying targets.” <text:s/>the stallion grumbled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P171">“<text:span text:style-name="T388">Well, I&apos;m going to tell you now. <text:s/>You are not capable of relocating me. <text:s/>It&apos;s not like I intend to threaten the town either, so I don&apos;t know why you need me to move in the first place.” <text:s/>Audrey said as she got up and left the tent. <text:s/>Outside she found that a circle of guards surrounded the tent each with a glowing horn. <text:s/>“You actually used this opportunity. <text:s/>I&apos;m a little surprised actually, so what happens now?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P171">“<text:span text:style-name="T389">Now, you surrender and we send somewhere far away.” <text:s/>the leader said as he came out of the tent as well.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P171">“<text:span text:style-name="T389">Nah, I&apos;m not much of a fighter, but I think I try my luck with resisting.” <text:s/>Audrey said as she grabbed the sword impaling her by the blade and pulled it out. <text:s/>A small waterfall of blood fell out <text:s/>the now gaping hole in her side as she said, “I may have forgotten to mention, I&apos;ve might be a little insane. <text:s/>Oh, and I can control my own blood.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">The ponies looked to the ground where the blood had fallen and saw that it had ball up into a black coagulated blob. <text:s/>A blob that was moving on its own. <text:s/>It jumped into Audrey&apos;s hand as she took a few magic bolts from the guards. <text:s/>They were beginning to panic and fire blindly at her hitting just about everything around. <text:s/>“Good thing those magicy things aren&apos;t lethal, huh.” <text:s/>she commented to the leader as he gaped at the scene from the ground after being hit a couple times. <text:s/>She flung the biomass in her hand in an arc at the guards in front of her and shouted, “Acid Blood.” <text:s/>They all ended up with some of the biomass splattered on them and started flailing around trying to get it off. <text:s/>The soon discovered that it was effectively glued to their coats which lead to them trying to run away. <text:s/>The camp had descended into total chaos as Audrey calmly walked out of it and back into the forest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“What did you do?” <text:s/>the deer from earlier screeched. <text:s/>She had been waiting at the edge of forest after giving up on finding her barrel. <text:s/>Looking back at the camp Audrey saw the occasional magic bolt fly into the sky and most of the tents had been knocked down. <text:s/>At least one of the ponies was running around with a tent covering him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“I tried to be diplomatic. <text:s/>I don&apos;t think I&apos;m very good at it. <text:s/>They should eventually realize that they are panicking over nothing.” <text:s/>Audrey answered and rolled her shoulder until it popped. <text:s/>“Huh, they actually managed to break my shoulder.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“That&apos;s not nothing, you razed the entire camp.” <text:s/>said the deer as she continued to gawk.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“No, they razed their own camp. <text:s/>I just scared them when they tried to capture me.” <text:s/>Audrey corrected. <text:s/>“Actually, I should diplomacy you too.” <text:s/>Audrey said causing the deer to blanch and give her big doe eyes. <text:s/>“Oh stop that, I&apos;m sure this attempt will go better. <text:s/>Since you already know some of it, I have infected all the trees from here to about half a kilometer in and have no intention of changing that. <text:s/>Don&apos;t try cure these trees or... <text:span text:style-name="T391">you&apos;ll probably end up dead</text:span>.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“That&apos;s not diplomacy, that&apos;s just bullying.” <text:s/>the deer shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“Oh... um, I think I <text:span text:style-name="T391">need to find a teacher then</text:span>... <text:s/>Why do you want to cure the <text:span text:style-name="T391">trees</text:span> anyway? <text:s/>They <text:soft-page-break/>aren&apos;t going to die or anything. <text:s/>Its mainly so I can make my own food and keep track of any other monsters wandering too close.” <text:s/>Audrey conceded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“I don&apos;t trust you, but I can&apos;t really do anything right now. <text:s/>We will be watching you.” <text:s/>the deer said and walked away. <text:s/>Once out of sight she started running. <text:s/>Audrey returned the blackened trees to normal and removed the virus from the &apos;blood&apos; on the guards after shifting it to wood. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">That should confuse them, </text:span>Audrey thought as she returned her body to a tree and shifted her attention back to her pony body.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">Shortly after breakfast Wild Way was in the main room when she saw the state of the guard camp out the window. <text:s/>She crept up to the window and peeked over the sill. <text:s/>Her ears were flat <text:span text:style-name="T392">against</text:span> her head and <text:span text:style-name="T392">her deep frown hidden under the window</text:span>.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“What&apos;s wrong, dear?” <text:s/>Rose asked and laid a hoof on Wild&apos;s back causing her to tense for a second.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“The camp&apos;s on fire.” <text:s/>Wild <text:span text:style-name="T392">grumbled already planning how to counter the blaze. <text:s/>She started creating underground vesicles throughout the forest a meter or so beneath the ground. <text:s/>She was careful to compact the dirt into biomass to not make any visible terrain disruptions. <text:s/>That would take a few hours, but was easy to delegate to the back of her mind. <text:s/>Once finished she would fill them with water from the aquifer below the forest so she had quick and easy access to enough water to extinguish any inferno. <text:s/>The trees above would be used to vent air or water as needed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“Don&apos;t worry, it looks like they just made a bonfire. <text:s/>It will be gone in a few hours. <text:s/>Although, <text:span text:style-name="T392">I don&apos;t know why they would need one</text:span>.” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T390">Rose placated rubbing Wild&apos;s back. <text:s/>She did relax some but never took her eyes off the bonfire even when Aura joined them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“<text:span text:style-name="T392">It&apos;s too close, it could spark and then... then I would be on fire. <text:s/>All of my trees aflame, an unstoppable wildfire.” <text:s/>Wild intoned working herself into a panic as she back away from the window. <text:s/>Rose drew her into a hug before she could get too far though.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P172">“<text:span text:style-name="T392">I&apos;m sure they are making sure that the fire is contained, but what do you mean your trees?” <text:s/>Rose asked before she put the pieces together and added, “Oh, you&apos;re hiding in plain sight as some of the trees?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">Wild nodded and said, “All of the visible ones for a ways into to the forest.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">Aura voiced her approval, but Rose coughed, “There&apos;s nearly a kilometer of tree line visible from here.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“Does this mean we can play in the Everfree forest?” Aura asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“No.” <text:s/>Rose answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">Wild managed to make it through the rest of the day only glaring periodically at the bonfire until it was finally burned out. <text:s/>To her confusion the guards had packed up their camp and were moving into the forest. <text:s/>To her surprise more guards showed up not long after and by the evening she had whole platoon camping in her forest. <text:s/>Unfortunately she forgot that camping meant there would be a campfire until she felt the faint heat from the fire.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173"><text:soft-page-break/>That got Wild&apos;s full attention and the first warning the ponies got was a low growl coming from the entire forest around them. <text:s/>In response they started gathering together even the sentries moving toward the campfire in preparation for a fight. <text:s/>Picking one of the trees nearby Wild changed the bark into a mesh of green bioluminescent sacs to illuminate the area. <text:s/>She wanted to see every trace of the fire be eliminated and created a pair of eyes on the same tree. <text:s/>Glaring at the fire she found the cistern underneath the fire that she had made earlier today and let the roof of it begin stretching until it sunk well below the water line creating a muddy mess and obliterating the small campfire. <text:s/>Now that the fire was gone she relaxed and started contracting the cistern roof again using it like a strainer to put the ground mostly back the way it was.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">Now that she was focusing solely on a fire, Wild noticed that her pony body was being shaken. <text:s/>She had fallen limp when her attention shifted and flopped onto the ground with the book she was reading upside down next to her. <text:s/>The other ponies in the home called out variation of &apos;are you OK?&apos; <text:s/>as she got back up. <text:s/>“I&apos;m fine. <text:s/>It&apos;s just the guards decided to make a campfire, so I was paying attention to that instead of this body. <text:s/>Sorry you guys.” <text:s/>She explained.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“Ah, in the forest you took over.” <text:s/>Rose said nodding. <text:s/>“Try not to give us such a scare next, alright. <text:s/>But, how did you handle it?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“I made a sink hole under it.” <text:s/>Wild answered listening to the tirade of the leader pony, <text:s/>“Uh, I don&apos;t think their leader is happy about some of the guards falling in.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“I hope you&apos;re not going to leave them in there.” <text:s/>Rose admonished.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“I filled the hole back in after the fire died, so its just a shallow mud pit now.” said Wild.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“<text:span text:style-name="T393">Close enough. <text:s/>You know its OK to have a quiet day.” <text:s/>Rose said with a shake of her head.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“<text:span text:style-name="T393">But then who would keep the monsters away.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">Rose had a false start before she said, “Yeah, I suppose the guard is not really up to the task between the roc yesterday, and them going camping when a storm is scheduled.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“There&apos;s a storm today?” Wild said as the rain started right on cue. <text:s/>“Oh, the leader is trying to the talk to me.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“What&apos;s he trying to do?” <text:s/>Rose asked. <text:s/>Wild <text:span text:style-name="T394">had developed a way to create biological speakers in an attempt to replicate an iPod. <text:s/>She had realized she could not actually use it since she was hiding, but stuck with it since living in the NYZ was filled with dead time. <text:s/>Now would be a perfect time to debut them by relaying what she heard in the forest through her body.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“... <text:span text:style-name="T394">second time you attack the Equestrian army. <text:s/>I am going to end your reign of terror.” <text:s/>the leader shouted.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T395">I think you&apos;re overreacting a bit, I was just putting out a fire.” <text:s/>Wild responded nearly causing the leader to bust a vein.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T395">You... you use dark magic this morning, and now try to drown 6 of my stallions. <text:s/>Now, you claim </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T395">you were &apos;just putting out a fire&apos;. <text:s/>Horseapples.” he yelled and descended into kicking at the glowing tree.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“<text:span text:style-name="T395">Wild, what did he mean by &apos;this morning&apos;?” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T276">Rose asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183"><text:span text:style-name="T276">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T395">I stopped by their camp to convince them not to hunt me. <text:s/>It ended in chaos after my daring escape.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T276">Wild answered before adding, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T395">I&apos;m not very good at diplomacy.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“<text:span text:style-name="T395">We are going to talk about that latter.”</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T276"> <text:s/>Rose said her head in her hooves. <text:s/>Wild folded her ears down at that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183"><text:span text:style-name="T276">“Fire is dangerous, why wouldn&apos;t I react that way?” <text:s/>Wild said, “Also, what&apos;s dark magic by the way?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183"><text:span text:style-name="T276">“You made a 10m wide sinkhole to put out a small fire. <text:s/>You really are insane, and now you&apos;re driving me insane too.” <text:s/>he seethed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183"><text:span text:style-name="T276">“I really don&apos;t like fire. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T277">Look, can we just agree to leave each other alone, and never make any more <text:s/>fires.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183"><text:span text:style-name="T277">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T278">No we can&apos;t just part ways. <text:s/>Now surrender, or we will burn down this tree.” <text:s/>the stallion said before a inaudible rumble began. <text:s/>The ponies could not hear it, but they could feel that the mood had changed drastically.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T57">Wild, please don&apos;t hurt them.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T396">Rose requested having some idea of how Wild would react to threats.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T396">Do you really think that&apos;s a good idea?” <text:s/>Wild intoned as some of the unicorns surrounded her glowing tree. <text:s/>They lit their horns and created a magical shield containing the entire tree. <text:s/>As more ponies came up Wild removed the eyes from the tree and changed the glow to blood red starting from the base of the tree and climbing up through every branch.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T396">You&apos;re trapped inside that shield. <text:s/>Now stop hiding in that tree.” <text:s/>the leader demanded. <text:s/>Wild actually complied with that and had her human body exit the tree. <text:s/>However, she left a thick fleshy cord attaching her to the tree and left her eye sockets empty. <text:s/>The ponies flinched at that and the ones not casting were murmuring between themselves. <text:s/>The canopy blocked the rain from soaking the ponies, but the peal of thunder could still be easily heard.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T396">You still aren&apos;t a threat to me, but I don&apos;t think you understand how much I dislike fire.” <text:s/>Wild said as she used the cord to lift her body in the air with dangling feet. <text:s/>Using the leverage the cord gave her she threw a punch at the shield in front of the leader. <text:s/>To his credit he did not flinch but all of the casting unicorns recoiled as a solid thump that could be felt by the entire platoon.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T58">You&apos;re making the situation worse.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T397"><text:s/>Rose said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“<text:span text:style-name="T397">I was hoping that I could just intimidate them.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T279">Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T396">Your theatrics won&apos;t work, that punch didn&apos;t even crack your cage.” <text:s/>the leader taunted easing some of the tension in his troops. <text:s/>“Now put on these restraints, or I will ignite you.” <text:s/>he said and threw a pair </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T396">of hoofcuffs through the shield with intricate runes etched into them. <text:s/>Wild did pick them up, and even put them on, but she had no intention of being compliant. <text:s/>Instead she got an idea from the thunder and started drawing water into the tree.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P184"><text:span text:style-name="T279">A brilliant lightning bolt struck the tree</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T278">. <text:s/>The </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280">brine</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T278"> kept the tree from igniting but a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280">pockets of steam erupted form the bark as the water was superheated</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T278">. <text:s/>For Wild it was unpleasant but only a little painful, the unicorns maintaining the shield however were on the ground, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280">and the rest of the ponies were covering their ears</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T278">. <text:s/>The lightning strike had completely demolished the shield when it passed through </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280">and the feedback knocked the casters unconscious</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T278">. <text:s/>“Ow. <text:s/>That one hurt a little.” she said </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280">while trying to clear her ear with a finger</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T278">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P184">“<text:span text:style-name="T398">What just happened?” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280">Rose asked. <text:s/>The rumble of thunder could be felt inside the building and the audio cut out as Wild hearing was damage as well by the strike.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P184"><text:span text:style-name="T280">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T398">Uh, lightning struck the tree. <text:s/>I knew it was dangerous, but this is more than I expected.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280">Wild marveled as she survey the damage. <text:s/>The conscious ponies were moving at least, although at least one was having a seizure. <text:s/>The only one still in a working state were the few earth ponies that were in the platoon. <text:s/>They had been further away from the blast and escaped any physical damage do to their natural resilience. <text:s/>“Hey earth ponies, start checking on the injured. <text:s/>Give a shout if any of them don&apos;t have a pulse.” <text:s/>Wild barked channeling her stolen memories of drill instructors. <text:s/>It gave the guards something familiar to focus on that the eagerly latched onto.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P184"><text:span text:style-name="T280">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T398">Wild, please tell me you didn&apos;t cause that strike.”</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280"> <text:s/>Rose pleaded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P184"><text:span text:style-name="T280">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T398">... I can&apos;t. <text:s/>I tried to use it to break that shield...” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280">Wild confessed while pawing at the ground, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T398">“Lightning is more powerful than I thought.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280">She went from pony to pony doing a quick diagnosis. <text:s/>Several lacked a pulse but she was able to restart their heart in most cases. <text:s/>If nothing else the doctors in Blackwatch did know their trade and now Wild could put that stolen knowledge to a good use.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P184">“<text:span text:style-name="T398">Oh, child...” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T280"><text:s/>Rose sighed and frowned a she considered Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P185"><text:span text:style-name="T70">Wild felt her heart drop as tears pooled in her eyes. <text:s/></text:span>“Do... you hate me, now.” <text:span text:style-name="T70"><text:s/>Wild cried.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P185">“No, but I am disappointed.” <text:span text:style-name="T70">Rose said wiping the tears off of Wild&apos;s face, </text:span>“Ponies make mistakes, and the more powerful they are the worse the consequences. <text:s/>Can you promise me that you won&apos;t hurt anyone else?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P175">After some thought Wild said, “<text:span text:style-name="T13">I can promise to never intentionally harm anyone unless </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T59">they are </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T59">trying to harm someone</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">.</text:span>”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P185">“...I&apos;ve met attorneys less pedantic.” <text:span text:style-name="T70">Rose said, </text:span>“Yeah, that works. Now say the promise and finish it with: &apos;cross my heart, and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.&apos;” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T70">She even did the motions to go along with the rhyme.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P185">“I swear under threat of hellfire to never intentionally harm anyone unless <text:span text:style-name="T399">they are acting to harm someone</text:span>. <text:s/>Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.” <text:span text:style-name="T70">Wild promised and performed the actions. <text:s/>As soon as they were complete a tingle ran through her entire body including the forest and all of the underground structures. <text:s/>All of the animals and ponies in the forest and Rose&apos;s home felt more than heard a low rumble. <text:s/>Wild hesitated, </text:span>“Uh, what?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P176">“<text:span text:style-name="T13">Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise.” </text:span>Aura explained <text:span text:style-name="T399">before starting a pony pile on Wild</text:span>. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P176"><text:span text:style-name="T399">The effort to treat the injured had progressed to the point that all of them were stable, or dead. <text:s/>Most of them suffered hearing loss and a variety of small cuts. <text:s/>A few of them actually had large splinters embedded in their skin from the steam explosions. <text:s/>Wild was able to treat those easily and they would heal on their own eventually. <text:s/>The worst were three of the casters that had burns starting at their horns. <text:s/>The horns were blackened and cracked leaving little question about their chances. <text:s/>Three body bags would be needed for them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">The six ponies that had been caught in the mud returned after the most of the ponies had been treated. <text:s/>They had no clue what to do when they found the monster they were looking for working with three of their colleagues. <text:s/>Even more shocking was the fact that over 20 ponies were laying on the ground in various states of injury along with three suspiciously large sealed brown bags.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“What the buck happened here?” <text:s/>one of new arrivals shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“Lightning strike.” <text:s/>Wild said and pointed to the mangled tree with scorch marks and craters covering its surface.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">The silence broken one of the earth ponies, a mare this time, asked, “What was that most recent rumble from the forest?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“A geas more or less.” Wild answered immediately getting the focus of all the conscious ponies, “What, is that a problem?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“Geas&apos; are banned, and how would you know that, anyway?” <text:s/>one of the freshly cleaned unicorns snapped.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“Not technically a geas, but it has the same effect. <text:s/>I know because I placed it on myself.” <text:s/>Wild answered and leaned against a tree to observe the reactions. <text:s/>Most of the ponies gave her a raised eyebrow or quirked head, but the earth mare that asked the initial question furrowed her brow in thought.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“But why would the entire forest react,” <text:s/>she wondered to herself before her eyes landed on the damaged tree. “unless...” she trailed off as the implication came to her. <text:s/>“No way. There&apos;s just no way.” <text:s/>she whispered after blanching at the thought.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177"><text:soft-page-break/>“There&apos;s always a way,” <text:s/>Wild said as she walked off. <text:s/>“and a cost.” she added before disappearing from the ponies line of sight and reintegrating with the forest. <text:s/>A couple of the guards tried to follow, but they were too slow and only found empty forest. <text:s/>In order to stop the guards from making any more fires she set up softly glowing orange bulbs among the trees so the ponies could see. <text:s/>Only one of the ponies had any idea of where they came from.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">As evening turned to night a question plagued Wild. <text:s/>It took a few hours but she did work up the nerve to ask Rose, “Why aren&apos;t you afraid of me?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“There isn&apos;t really a simple answer to that.” Rose said taking a moment to collect her thoughts. <text:s/>“I&apos;ve been here at this children&apos;s home for a long time and seen many foals come through those doors. <text:s/>Many that have had a hard life and found ways to cope. <text:s/>Being a changeling I get to cheat most of the time, but even though I can&apos;t with you, it has become very obvious that you avoid confrontation. <text:s/>You may go straight to the extremes when you act, but you are closer to a pacifist than some vicious beast. <text:s/>You tried to scare those guards away rather than directly fight them after all.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">Wild&apos;s face screwed up in confusion when she, “Me a pacifist.” <text:s/>She wanted to say that was ridiculous, but thinking back the only time she actually started a fight was with the Blackwatch group that held her captive. <text:s/>The things they did... If that did not count as an extenuating circumstance then nothing would.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">After letting Wild mull over those words Rose continued, “Mhm, then there&apos;s the location to consider. <text:s/>This has never been a safe area and not just because of the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Ponies don&apos;t have <text:s/>a very high regard for changelings. <text:s/>Being discovered is a very real, very serious risk. <text:s/>Overall, you have made Ponyville a safer place even if the townsponies don&apos;t realize it.”</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P102" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 5</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T321">Wild trotted down the road toward the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Entering the forest at night is inadvisable, but Wild Way could easily handle whatever she was likely to find. <text:s/>That was even her intent, after the encounter with Martial she decided it was time to bulk up. <text:s/>There was still a few hours of darkness, and she was on the hunt, preferably for something large and predatory. <text:s/>Figuring that none of the animals would be wary of a pony, her method of hunting was to loudly waltz around the forest like a fool until something ate her. <text:s/>A pretty quick and dirty plan, but one that will suit her needs.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T322">A manticore turned out to be the first taker and began following her after a while wandering aimlessly. <text:s/>Wild sensed the beast at about the same time as it found her, ironically both of them were smug about finding easy prey. <text:s/>A few minutes later and the manticore left with a full belly figuring it got to eat a foolish pony. <text:s/>A rare delicacy among Everfree carnivores, although the pony did not make as much noise as it expected. <text:s/>Walking back to its den the manticore got its first indication of a problem when it felt a sharp pain near its stomach. <text:s/>Within a minute the manticore lay dead on the ground with its former pride warily eying the scene. <text:s/>When the tendrils erupt from the corpse that was enough for the other manticores and the all scattered to the winds to avoid a similar fate.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T323">Wild got up from the ground as a black and red viral manticore. <text:s/>Stretching and walking around she examined her new body. <text:s/>Her limbs looked like some cross between braided black tendrils with a few red streaks along their surface and a chitinous claw with spikes at each of the joints. <text:s/>Her body was a bit more normal the fur was black and the flesh underneath an angry red randomly glaring out in spots. <text:s/>The wings and tail were unchanged aside from color still webbed bat wings and segmented scorpion like tail.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T324">OK</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T31">, two things, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112">Wild thought while heading back to Ponyville, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T34">Why</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T31"> does a mammal this large need venom, and this is the ugliest thing I have ever seen outside of the NYZ. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112">Not wanting to spend anymore time looking like this she shifted back to being a pony. <text:s/>This time though she a surplus of biomass to deal with. <text:s/>She increased the density of her bones and muscles as well as adding some more muscle mass. <text:s/>She also added a layer of fat to appear healthier, and not be hard enough to make rocks jealous. <text:s/>As an afterthought she also made a new set of stitches and bandage to replace the old ones still with her &apos;remains&apos;. <text:s/>The pair of bags always adorning her sides was also replaced and she was presentable once more.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T112"><text:tab/>Wanting to learn more about the manticores since she got the new form Wild decided to visit the Library. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">Crossed the boundary between the forest and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">apple </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">orchard i</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112">t was still too early </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">for the library to be open</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112">, the sun was only just rising on the horizon. <text:s/>Not having anything else to do she instead wandered to kill time. <text:s/>At first a only an occasional pony would ask about the bandage on her shoulder to which she would tell them a tame version of the events. <text:s/>By the time the library was open nearly everyone she passed </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">was </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112">express</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">ing</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112"> their condolences and reassurance that the rest of Ponyville was very accepting.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T112"><text:tab/>More than a bit </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">surprised</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112"> at the speed of gossip in small towns Wild knocked on the door to the library. <text:s/>Instead of the purple librarian she was meet by a large purple and green bipedal lizard. <text:s/>After greeting him she found out that he was actually a dragon. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35">I did not expect a</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T31"> dragon in a library, maybe he doesn&apos;t breath fire, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112">Wild thought </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">worried about the possibility of fire</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">Skirting around the edge of the library she c</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112">ollect</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">ed</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112"> a</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">n</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112"> Everfree bestiary </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">and</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112"> settled down for a day of learning.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T112"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">So manticore venom is paralytic, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T113">Wild mused reading through the section on manticores, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">and they use it to keep their food fresh... <text:s/>That&apos;s enough for that line of thought. <text:s/>Hmm, a paralytic could be useful beyond just poisoning things. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T113">While Wild was considering the possibilities, the door to the library gently opened to admit a yellow pegasus mare. <text:s/>She had a pastel pink mane, trio of butterflies for a cutie mark, and was urgently looking around the library.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:tab/>“Twilight,” she called loud enough for Wild to hear her, but nowhere near enough to be heard outside the room. <text:s/>Trotting in place she decided to venture deeper in to the library in search of the local librarian.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:tab/>Soon the pegasus and Twilight entered the main room. <text:s/>“What&apos;s wrong Fluttershy?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T113"><text:tab/>“Oh Twilight, its terrible, some pony was wandering in the Everfree forest last night </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T116">and I don&apos;t think they came back out</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T113">.” <text:s/>Fluttershy babbled, “I just don&apos;t know what to do. I was hoping that you might have some idea.” <text:s/>Both of the other ponies in the room were paying full attention, but for very </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T113">different reasons.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T113"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">What the hell, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T113">Wild panicked, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">I can&apos;t imagine any other pony going into the forest, but how did she know about the manticore. <text:s/>This is bad, I figured nature would take care of the &apos;remains&apos;. <text:s/>OK, damage control time.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T32"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T113">Spike!” Twilight yelled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:tab/>“What is it, Twilight?” Spike returned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T113"><text:tab/>“I need you to take a letter.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T114">Twilight answered waiting just long enough for Spike to get a scroll and quill before dictating</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:tab/>“Dear Princess Celestia,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T113"><text:tab/>My friend Fluttershy and I are going into the Everfree forest </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T114">to... retrieve a lost pony that may have been attacked by a manticore.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>Your Most Faithful Student,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>Twilight Sparkle”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>“Are you really going into the Everfree, what if you get lost too?” <text:s/>Spike worried when he finished the letter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>“There&apos;s no time Spike we have to hurry.” Twilight stressed as she exited the library towing Fluttershy along with her. <text:s/>Figuring that the arguing was hopeless, Spike sent the letter praying that the princess would be able to handle this.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>In order to send the letter Spike used his flame breath enchanted to be able to send scroll to distant ponies. <text:s/>The ash would fly away and be reconstructed into the original scroll when it reached the recipient. <text:s/>Unfortunately for her sake, Wild Way had a strong phobia of fire. <text:s/>However, fortunately for everyone else was distracted when she leapt to the roof and used her tendrils to cling on. <text:s/>Her presence of mind did not return until the reply scroll came in a burp of fire, and Spike began reading it aloud.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>“Dear Twilight,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>I trust your judgment, but please use caution both the Everfree forest and manticores are not something to take lightly. <text:s/>I will also be sending a specialist to assist either in the actual retrieval of the missing pony, or in returning the pony to their home, as the case may be.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T325">Sincerely,</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T325">Princess Celestia,” Spike finished before running to the door.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T325">After dropping to the ground while Spike was turned away Wild called out, </text:span>“<text:span text:style-name="T325">Wait, I can take that letter for you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T325">Spike stopped to consider the offer, but rebutted, “I can&apos;t ask you to go into the Everfree.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T325">You don&apos;t need to worry about me, I&apos;ve made it through worse things.” <text:s/>Wild reassured with a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T325">smile that in no way reflected her emotions. “The library also needs someone to runs things, and I promise I will keep Twilight safe.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T325">Alright, since you promise.” Spike gave in with a brave facade. “I will make sure the library is running smoothly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T325">Taking the scroll in her mouth, Wild put it in her bags and left the library. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T33">Good, I&apos;ve got a reason to join Twilight&apos;s mission, now I just need a reason why my partially eaten corpse is lying around in the Everfree. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T115">She groaned mentally, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T33">Also, a princess is involved. <text:s/>Why did a princess have to be involved. <text:s/>I wonder what Lyra will think of this. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T115">She added in while hurrying down the road to catch up with the <text:s/>pair of would-be rescuers.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25"><text:tab/>Wild caught up to the pair not far into the forest to their surprise. <text:s/>Twilight asked, “Wild Way what are you doing here.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T115"><text:tab/>“I came to give you the reply from the princess.” <text:s/>Wild stated before grabbing the letter out of her bag. <text:s/>Twilight took it and read the entire thing out loud. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T116">Well, it&apos;s dangerous to be alone in the Everfree, you should come with us Wild.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T116"><text:tab/>The trio proceed deeper into the forest, Wild was confident that she could handle any trouble, but the other two were </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T117">much more tense. <text:s/>Wild was much less confident with how things would go when the reached her body. <text:s/>“Hey Fluttershy, how did you know that someone got lost in the forest?” Wild inquired figuring she could at least find out how to avoid being detected next time.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26"><text:tab/>“Oh, my animal friends saw them go in but not come out.” Fluttershy squeaked the low volume not a problem for Wild&apos;s hearing.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T117"><text:tab/>“Ah, they sound pretty helpful.” <text:s/>Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">said while thinking, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T34">She created a town wide fuzzy spy network, and probably doesn&apos;t even realize it. <text:s/>Although, they didn&apos;t notice me passing through that orchard. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">Wild waited a little before her next question, “Hey girls, what if this pony is in more than one piece?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T118"><text:tab/>Oddly Twilight was the only one to react strongly, Fluttershy just looked saddened. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t even want to think about that, but we will bring them back to Ponyville.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T119">Twilight declared just managing to keep a hold on her breakfast.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T119"><text:tab/>The scent of blood reached the ponies causing two of them to sprint ahead, Wild reluctantly kept up with them. <text:s/>Already knowing the general state of the body she was more interesting in the reactions, specifically Twilights. <text:s/>Twilights had visibly paled at the sight, her eyes shrunken to pinpricks, and already </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T120">hyperventilating.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T119"> <text:s/>“Are you going to be alright, Twilight?” Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T120">worried</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T119">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T119"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T120">Twilight turned to reply, but instead of words Wild got a up close look at what Twilight had for breakfast. <text:s/>Twilight ended up on the ground in a dead faint. <text:s/>“Right, I&apos;ll just take that as a no.” Wild deadpanned while creating a rag to clean herself off. <text:s/>“I probably deserved </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T121">that</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T120">.” she mumbled </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T121">and lifted Twilight onto her back. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T122">Turning back to Fluttershy Wild saw that the yellow pegasus was looking slowing looking between the body and Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T122"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T123">Um, if you don&apos;t mind me asking why do you look </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T125">just</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T123"> like this poor pony?” <text:s/>Fluttershy asked long after the silence became awkward.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T123"><text:tab/>After a few false starts Wild bit the bullet and answer, “Well, you see it was my body.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T124">Pawing at the ground and looking everywhere but at Fluttershy, “Sorry for making you come into the Everfree, but I didn&apos;t know what to do.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T124"><text:tab/>“Oh don&apos;t worry about it, I </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T125">forgive you.” <text:s/>Fluttershy cooed</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27"><text:tab/>“You are taking all of this surprisingly well” <text:s/>Wild observed and looked back at the unconscious <text:s/>unicorn on her back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T125"><text:tab/>“Oh, you just somewhat remind me of my animal friends. <text:s/>Not that I think you are an animal or anything.” <text:s/>Fluttershy </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T126">confessed with a blush.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28"><text:tab/>“Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m not insulted. <text:s/>You are more right than you think. <text:s/>While not living like an wild animal, I didn&apos;t really live like a pony.” Wild tapered off. <text:s/>She was rather surprised when a pair of forelegs wrapped around her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T126"><text:tab/>“You made it to Ponyville, you don&apos;t have to live like that anymore.” Fluttershy soothed. <text:s/>Even though Wild already knew that hearing it from someone else made it sink in. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T127">Soon a few drops of liquid landed on Fluttershy&apos;s back as her hug was returned. The moment lasted until Twilight started to stir.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29"><text:tab/>“Welcome back Twilight, you might not want to look around too much.” <text:s/>Wild suggested.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29"><text:tab/>“What did I miss?” Twilight asked still groggy from her impromptu nap.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29"><text:tab/>“Not much I just identified the body.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T127"><text:tab/>“The body?” <text:s/>Twilight </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T128">repeated before gasping, “Oh my gosh, that poor pony, and all I did was throw up. Oh no, I am so sorry Wild Way.” <text:s/>Twilight had hopped to the ground and began pacing.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“Twilight! Calm down, I already cleaned up the vomit and its not a big a deal.” <text:s/>Wild exclaimed, “This is a little awkward, but the body is actually mine. Sorry about making you trek through the Everfree.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“What?” Twilight blurted out and inspected the body, “but thats not possible, you are there so you can&apos;t be over there...”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>Wild grabbed Twilight to break her out of her rambling before explaining, “So I am not exactly what you might call a normal pony. <text:s/>Among other things I can regenerate myself from even a small part of my body.” <text:s/>Wild pawed at the ground to stall, before continuing “So, the less than complete me is from yesterday, and I am regenerated from the... missing pieces.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“Missing... oh... Oh gross.” <text:s/>Twilight grimaced while Wild just shrugged. <text:s/>“Wait in order to do that you would need to get material from somewhere.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“Well, that is true, but are you sure you want to continue that line of reasoning.” <text:s/>Wild confirmed hoping that Twilight would not react too poorly. <text:s/>There is no way that she could resist <text:soft-page-break/>thinking about an unsolved mystery.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“Ah, you used the food that the animal ate.” <text:s/>Twilight deduced even Fluttershy raised an eyebrow at that.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“Was it at least quick?” <text:s/>Fluttershy questioned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T128"><text:tab/>“Yes, only a few seconds.” <text:s/>Wild answered receiving a nod from Fluttershy. <text:s/>A large shadow was the only warning the ponies got before a large form dropped out of the sky </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T129">grab, the partial pony body and flew away. <text:s/>“Right, we should go back to Ponyville.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31"><text:tab/>On the way back Twilight asked, “Wild Way, why did you think you needed to keep your abilities?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:span text:style-name="T129"><text:tab/>“Simply put, I was afraid of how you would react. <text:s/>The abilities I have are terrifying, they go far beyond just regeneration. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T130">I wasn&apos;t the only one who got them, everyone else considered us monsters. <text:s/>For good reason too.” Wild lamented before scrunching her muzzle in thought. <text:s/>She decided to risk it and pleaded, “I knew I wouldn&apos;t be able to keep it secret, nor do I really want to. <text:s/>I hope that you two will keep this part secret.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P32"><text:tab/>Letting out a breath before confessing, “I am a virus.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:span text:style-name="T130"><text:tab/>“You&apos;re a... </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T132">what</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T130">, how would that even work?” <text:s/>Twilight inquire</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T131">d </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T132">skeptical of Wild&apos;s claim</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T130">. <text:s/>Fluttershy was still patiently listening her expression remaining unchanged throughout the whole conversation.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:span text:style-name="T130"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T131">I am not entirely sure. <text:s/>I used to be a person same as </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T139">anyone</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T131"> before I was infected. <text:s/>After the virus ran its course I ended up in control with the same mind as before. <text:s/>I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m a mass of infected cells with control over the infection, or the infection itself.” Wild mused focusing on explaining instead of what she was explaining, “I&apos;m not sure it matters either.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:span text:style-name="T131"><text:tab/>Twilight&apos;s brow furrowed as she digested the wealth of information allowing Fluttershy fill the lull. <text:s/>“Well I know that you aren&apos;t a monster. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T132">You didn&apos;t follow us into the Everfree forest to protect your secret, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">after all</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T132"> did you.” <text:s/>Now two of the ponies were lost in thought </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">on their forest trek</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T132">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P106" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 6</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T132"><text:tab/>The ponies </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">ended up </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T132">exit</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">ing</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T132"> the Everfree forest near Fluttershy&apos;s cottage. <text:s/>Saying goodbye Fluttershy returned to home to take care of her animal friends. <text:s/>Twilight had been giving Wild what she thought were discrete looks. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">Wild pretended not to notice in wondering what Twilight was working up to.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Wild Way, can I ask you a personal question?” Twilight pleaded even using puppy dog eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Sure, there&apos;s no need to stop now.” <text:s/>Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“How do you function?” <text:s/>Twilight asked before she rephrased it as, “I mean, how does your regeneration work?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“All of my abilities aren&apos;t truly abilities but different ways I can exploit the fact that I am a network of connected infected cells that I can control on a genetic level.” <text:s/>Wild explained enjoying the chance to share knowledge with someone, “The regeneration is literally just moving the cells back into place and growing more as needed.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“You&apos;re a gestalt” Twilight started before the explanation fully set in. <text:s/>She exclaimed, “You can control your genetics, the potential of that is...” <text:s/>Twilight trailed off as she imagined the possibilities.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T133"><text:tab/>Wild decided to rescue Twilight from her own mind. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35">This is such a terrible idea, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">Wild admitted <text:s/>as she approached Twilight, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35">but its been so long since I got to prank someone</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">. <text:s/>“I could even do something like this...”, Wild smirked and gently touched Twilight&apos;s foreleg. <text:s/>As she returned her own foreleg to the ground she began shifting. <text:s/>She kept the tendrils to a minimum, but Twilight was still disturbed by the act. <text:s/>After only a few seconds there were two Twilights standing just outside the Everfree forest.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Wild...” Twilight stammered surprised to see her own face in gray, “why are you gray?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>Inspecting a foreleg, Wild found that she was in fact an entirely gray Twilight. <text:s/>“I have no idea, I should be a clone of you.” she confessed worrying that there might be something wrong with her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“A clone, but the only time a pony would be that gray is if their magic is almost completely gone.” Twilight thought out loud intent on solving this mystery. <text:s/>“Oh no, you didn&apos;t use up all of your magic, did you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>Relieved that the problem was just a lack of magic. <text:s/>“Ponies coat color are based on magic?” Wild chuckled, “that explains it, I don&apos;t have any magic.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“No magic” <text:s/>Twilight gasped and tried to pull Wild with her, “we need to get you to the hospital before magic exhaustion sets in.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>Rolling her eyes Wild held Twilight&apos;s head still as she explained, “Twilight, I&apos;ll be fine I never had magic to begin with.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P73"><text:span text:style-name="T133"><text:tab/>“What” Twilight bleated and went catatonic. <text:s/>Wild tried waving her leg in front of Twilight and calling her name but got no response.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35"> <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T36">Damn, I did it again, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T134">Wild thought with a sigh.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133"> <text:s/>Reverting to her own form Wild headed back to the library with Twilight once more on her back. <text:s/>Once she got within sight of the library she saw a golden armored white unicorn giving her a bemused look.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“Ma&apos;am, why do you have Twilight Sparkle on your back?” <text:s/>the stallion asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m hoping her assistant knows how to wake her up, so I&apos;m bringing her back to the library.” <text:s/>Wild said stopping to talk to this new pony.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“I was informed that she and Fluttershy would be searching for a missing pony, I take that she went on ahead and ended up in this state?” he inquired his expression making it clear he wanted an answer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P73"><text:span text:style-name="T133"><text:tab/>“She did, but this state was a result of learning an odd piece of information.” Wild replied more </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T133">amused than intimidated by the unicorn. <text:s/>“Also can we move this to the library?” <text:s/>she requested. <text:s/>The stallion did not see a problem with it so the pair relocated to the Golden Oaks library. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T134">Spike greeted them when they entered, but applied his hand to his forehead when he saw Twilight.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“What happened this time?” Spike asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“Well, I just told her that I don&apos;t have any magic and then this.” <text:s/>Wild said indicating her insensate passenger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P73"><text:span text:style-name="T134"><text:tab/>“What?” both of the males deadpanned. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T135">After a pause to let that sink in Spike continued, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T134">“Well, that would do it </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T135">luckily its pretty easy to get her out of this state. <text:s/>Twilight, you&apos;re going to be late if you stay like that.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P73"><text:span text:style-name="T135"><text:tab/>Almost before he finished saying the woods Twilight began freaking out. <text:s/>“Late, no no no no no, I can&apos;t be late, I&apos;ve got-- Um, wait, when did we get to the library and why am I on your back Wild Way?” <text:s/>Twilight spew out and wiggled her hoo</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T136">ve</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T135">s uselessly until she noticed her position and hopped down to the floor.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P73"><text:span text:style-name="T135"><text:tab/>“I carried you here when you froze after I told...” Wild managed to get out before </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T136">her brain caught up</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T135">, “you some stuff.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P73"><text:span text:style-name="T135"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T136">O...Kay”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Also, a golden armored pony is here” Wild announced and looked over to the boys before continuing, “You&apos;re here for the missing pony thing, right?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Yes.” the stallion answered, “I am Special Agent Lucent Lodestar, the golden armored pony sent to aid in the search and rescue.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“I apologize for my friend here”, Twilight said before sending a glare to Wild. <text:s/>Wild just averted her eyes, so Twilight continued, “As for the missing pony, well there is no longer a missing pony.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P74"><text:span text:style-name="T70"><text:tab/>“That&apos;s an interesting way to phrase that, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T139">what happened to the missing pony?</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P74"><text:span text:style-name="T70"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T139">A</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70"> giant brown thing ate the corpse.” Wild supplied. <text:s/>Twilight&apos;s face and hooves met as she groaned. <text:s/>Lucent had a raised eyebrow, and spike was wide eyed prompting Wild to reassure, “Don&apos;t worry no one was hurt.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P74"><text:span text:style-name="T70"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T137">So, your story is that there was a corpse that got eaten by a roc, but no one was hurt. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T138">That&apos;s not the most believable story.” Lucent critiqued.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P74"><text:span text:style-name="T138"><text:tab/>“But it is technically correct.” Twilight deadpanned, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T139">do you really have to answer questions so candidly?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P74"><text:span text:style-name="T139"><text:tab/>“Yes” Wild answered her stance stiffening causing Lucent to narrow his eyes. <text:s/>Twilight just huffed </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T140">and recounted the events leaving out that Wild had originally been the corpse and how she managed to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T141">escape</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T140"> the manticore. <text:s/>Lucent or course wanted to know why she needed a manticore.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P74"><text:span text:style-name="T140"><text:tab/>“I have only been in Ponyville for a couple days, but I like to be prepared for threats. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T141">The </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T141">Everfree happens to contain a lot of different threats.” <text:s/>Wild explained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“That is one way to learn about threatening creatures, I would advise a book next time though.” <text:s/>Lucent retorted no longer certain of the sanity of this mare.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Sorry for making you come all the way out here for nothing.” <text:s/>Twilight apologized.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P74"><text:span text:style-name="T141"><text:tab/>“Don&apos;t worry about it, just learning about that roc sighting makes it worth it, but I&apos;m here to find out about a oddly large number of incidents in the past couple days.” <text:s/>Lucent reassured as he pulled out a list, “Let&apos;s see there a break in by a shadowy figure,” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T37">Shit, I knew that would come back, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T141">Wild thought</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T37">,</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T141"> “a full grown pony lacking a cutie mark wandered into town, a mare reported being stalked, said stalker was later arrested after stabbing the mare,” Twilight gasp and eyed Wild&apos;s bandage, “a pony devoid of magic was discovered at the hospital,” Twilight mumbled something about being impossible, <text:s/>“and finally a mare is reported lost in the Everfree forest.” <text:s/>Lucent finished and put away his list before asking Wild, “How many of these involve you miss Wild Way?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“All of them.” Wild squeaked out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Why were you sneaking into someones bedroom?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“To tap them on the shoulder.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“...Alright, thats enough for today. <text:s/>Ladies it was nice to meet you, and Miss Way you live an interesting life, the royal guard might contact you in the future.” <text:s/>Lucent declared before leaving the library. <text:s/>The two mares waved until he left.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“You broke into someones house?!” Twilight hissed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“I needed a DNA sample and its not like I just go and ask.” Wild defended.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>Unable to come up with a counter argument Twilight asked, “Where did Spike go?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“The kitchen, it is around lunch time I think,” Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Hey, you should stay for lunch.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Uh, OK.” <text:s/>Wild conceded and followed the smaller mare into the kitchen. <text:s/>Spike had actually expected the possibility of an extra guest so there was plenty of food. <text:s/>Twilight practically inhaled hers until she notice the stares. <text:s/>She blushed and decided to eat more calmly after that. <text:s/>Wild did her best to keep herself as far from Spike as she could, but eventually her fidgeting was noticed by Twilight.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Wild, whats wrong, you have been fidgeting like you need to use the bathroom for a while now?” <text:s/>Twilight worried.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P75"><text:span text:style-name="T141"><text:tab/>“Bathroom?” Wild repeated, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T37">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T141">Yes, I need to use the bathroom?” <text:s/>She got up and rushed off waiting just long enough to hear the location of the bathroom. <text:s/>Closing the door she set about her task of collecting water from the largest body of it in the room. <text:s/>Unfortunately the excess splashing attracted the attention of Twilight who came into the room to investigate.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Wild what are you doing in--” Twilight began while her brain took a couple seconds to process <text:soft-page-break/>the scene. <text:s/>“WHAT ARE YOU DOING THATS NOT HOW YOU USE A TOILET!” Twilight shouted with head pulled back in disgust. <text:s/>Wild Way was sitting in front of the toilet staring at Twilight with eyes wide open and body frozen in fear at being caught. <text:s/>Wild&apos;s head was lowered partially into the toilet bowl, and her foreleg was jammed into the drain far enough that her hoof was not visible. <text:s/>The other foreleg extended toward the handle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>The two were both at a loss on how to react to the other. <text:s/>Spike just yelled, “I&apos;M NOT CLEANING IT!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“This is exactly what it looks like.” Wild blurted now that Spike had broken the ice.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“I don&apos;t know what this looks like!” Twilight returned. <text:s/>“Don&apos;t flush it like that!” Twilight added when she saw a foreleg continue its journey.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“I need water, and this is the fastest way.” Wild explained before quickly flushing the toilet. <text:s/>Against Twilights expectation the water rushed into the bowl, but the level never rose instead seeming to disappear when it hit the foreleg clogging the bowl. <text:s/>Once the toilet was done flushing Wild pulled out her foreleg and flushed it one more time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>Twilight watched the whole process both intrigued and grossed out with it. <text:s/>Once it was complete she asked, “Why did you need so much water?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Afraid” Wild mumbled turning away from the purple mare.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Afraid of what?” Twilight prompted softer this time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P76"><text:span text:style-name="T70"><text:tab/>“Fire” was the barely audible reply that Twilight got. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T142">I have pyrophobia turns out regeneration and fire are not a great combination. <text:s/>Anyway, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T143">I find having water nearby comforting I just needed a little more.” <text:s/>Wild confessed regaining confidence through the whole thing, “Don&apos;t worry too much about it, this is my problem to deal with.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“You can rely on friends to help you, so don&apos;t feel obligated to do it all yourself.” Twilight protested, “Also, 3 gallons is not a little. <text:s/>I don&apos;t even know where you fit all of that.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“The fear is manageable for now.” Wild dismissed, “As for where the water is, well its not like I need all those vital organs. <text:s/>I&apos;m almost literally a walking water balloon.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>Twilight tried to hold a stern expression but relented to the absurdity of the pony in front of her. <text:s/>The girls moved to the main room to see Spike there who promptly grimaced and said, “I do not want to know what you two were doing in there.” <text:s/>The two of them just broke down into laughter when they realized what parts of the conversation Spike had heard. <text:s/>From there things returned to normal for the library with Wild returning to her book. <text:s/>It only took her another hour or so to finished it and absorb all of the information.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>Wild said goodbye to the library pair and set off into the town. <text:s/>She decided that after the events of today the only reasonable course of action would be to lazy around at the park. <text:s/>Picking a nice out of the way spot she settled down to watch the clouds. <text:s/>A completely mundane and not at all dangerous activity just like she wanted. <text:s/>Most of the afternoon passed while ponies played around her, but <text:soft-page-break/>eventually darker clods started getting pushed around the sky. <text:s/>All of the other ponies had left by then, except Wild who was distracted by the pegasi flitting around the darkening clouds.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P76"><text:span text:style-name="T143"><text:tab/>Wild was a bit confused when she found herself upside down in a large depression a few yards from where she was sitting. <text:s/>It had happened so fast that she didn&apos;t notice, but lightning had discharged from the clouds above her and since the area was clear of trees there was only one likely target. <text:s/>The lightning strike had caused her muscles to contract, her legs to extends and since she was laying on her belly, her entire body was flung into the sky. <text:s/>She reached the height of a three story building at the apex of her flight and caught the attention of all the nearby pegasi. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T144">Her trip finished with loud thud as she landed sending grass and dirt flying.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>As Wild stood up she saw a lilac pegasus broke away from the clouds a swoop down moving her mouth as if talking. <text:s/>Wild took a second to realize her own hearing was the problem and said “Hold on Flitter, my hearing isn&apos;t back yet.” <text:s/>Taking stock of herself Wild found that along with the hearing issue she had some superficial scarring and a her shoulder had reopened. <text:s/>She shook off the accumulated dirt and soot on her coat while healing her scarred back. <text:s/>Repairing her eardrum she was finally able to hear Flitter&apos;s frantic words. <text:s/>Understanding them was a different matter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“Flitter, I can&apos;t understand you unless you slow down.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>Taking a breath Flitter was able to get out, “Wild, you shouldn&apos;t be moving, and your bleeding and we need to get you to the hospital.” <text:s/>Flitter had been inspecting Wild for injuries, then switched to trying to push her to the hospital.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P76"><text:span text:style-name="T144"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T145">I&apos;m fine.” Wild protested, “See just a little blood, nothing to worry about.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“Nope, you are going to the hospital, and that blood it from your pulled stitches.” <text:s/>Flitter countered and herded the larger mare away. <text:s/>Wild grumbled, but went along with it anyway. <text:s/>The doctor visit went smoothly with Doctor Humor. <text:s/>He did comment on the several hundred pound weight increase, but did not dig deeper considering his patient&apos;s nature. <text:s/>Redoing the stitches he sent the mares on the way.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Not convinced, but not willing to contradict the doctor Flitter compromised on taking Wild Way to her house for overnight observation. <text:s/>Wild had little say in this decision, not that she really minded though.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P107" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 7</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Flitter was the first one awake the next day and entered the living room to check on Wild. <text:s/>Wild was laying on the couch head on one of the arm rest and legs folded up beneath her. <text:s/>As Flitter approached Wild woke up too.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“Sorry, didn&apos;t mean to wake you.” Flitter apologized.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“It&apos;s about time to wake up anyway, and I&apos;m a very light sleeper.” <text:s/>Wild moved off the couch and yawned, “Thanks for letting me stay the night, being outside in that storm would have been a bad <text:soft-page-break/>idea.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“I still can&apos;t believe that you got struck by lightning.” <text:s/>Flitter said then frowned as a thought came to her, “What do you mean being outside in the storm?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“Oh, I would have found something to bed down in, but all the rain would get annoying.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Flitter eyes widened and mouth opened as comprehension dawned on her. <text:s/>She whispered, “Thats why you always have those bags with you. <text:s/>You&apos;re homeless, aren&apos;t you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Wild just shrugged, “I&apos;m used to it at this point, I haven&apos;t had a home in years.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“You idiot, you should have told someone. <text:s/>With all of the injuries you get, its a miracle your still alive.” <text:s/>Flitter shouted. <text:s/>An almost awake Cloud Chaser stumbled into the room to observe the argument.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“Its not so bad, its like camping. <text:s/>Also, I am very difficult to kill. <text:s/>It would take a little more than some lightning to do me in.” <text:s/>Wild assured, but Flitter&apos;s eye twitch indicated that her words did not have the intended effect.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“That&apos;s not like camping at all.” Flitter scolded, “Should have had the doctor check your brain too. <text:s/>And just what do you mean difficult to kill?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m not exactly a normal pony, look even that lightning bolt barely did anything to me.” Wild pleaded prompting Flitter to approach. <text:s/>She looked for any obvious injuries and finding none started poking Wild in the side to check for less obvious ones. <text:s/>Her muzzle scrunched up, and one eye squinted as she stepped back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Chuckling Cloud Chaser added, “So you are the one that got hit by that bolt. <text:s/>I&apos;m not surprised she took it without injury Flitter, she did hop off the roof she was sleeping on like it was nothing. <text:s/>Even landed light as a feather, too. <text:s/>Of course you&apos;re not a normal pony, you&apos;re a secret agent ninja pony.” <text:s/>She finished with a raised hoof as a flourish.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“You knew she was sleeping on the streets and didn&apos;t say anything.” Flitter seethed turning her ire on her sister.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“Oh, look at the time. <text:s/>I think I hear breakfast calling.” <text:s/>Cloud blurted out before she and Wild scurried out of the room. <text:s/>Flitter followed them mumbling under her breath about strangling the other two ponies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P78"><text:span text:style-name="T145"><text:tab/>Once breakfast was finished, Flitter apologized, “I&apos;m sorry for </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T146">getting so puchy with you Wild. <text:s/>I just worry about you getting hurt. <text:s/>Uh, more hurt.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P78"><text:span text:style-name="T146"><text:tab/>“Aw, come here you.” Wild cooed while pulling Flitter into a hug, “I&apos;m sorry for worrying you, I just haven&apos;t had anyone worry about me in a long time.” <text:s/>Wild then leaned in </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T147">to whisper, “Though, even that lightning was barely enough to injure me.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Cloud Chaser agreed, “Yep, she&apos;s a ninja, but seriously how did you manage to get hit by lightning anyway. <text:s/>We don&apos;t let enough charge build up in the clouds to arc that far.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>Wild shrugged, “Maybe it accumulated from nearby clouds.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“Well, there will probably be an investigation on it, but we need to get to work.” Cloud said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“And if you need a place to sleep then feel free to come by.” Flitter added, before the three went there separate ways. Wild headed off to find Lyra figuring that she would probably be interested in the recent events. <text:s/>Lyra had already left by the time Wild made it to her house, but asking around she found <text:s/>out Lyra usually hangs around the park. <text:s/>Getting to the park it was easy to find the mint mare playing her lyre.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“Well if it isn&apos;t the talk of the town.” Lyra greeted once she finished her song, “You competing with Twilight and her gang or something?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“I don&apos;t think so, what did Twilight do?” Wild inquired.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“The early morning after she first got here she takes on a living legend. <text:s/>Nightmare Moon payed a visit to town, and Twilight just wanders through the Everfree and defeats her. <text:s/>That was only the day before you got here and Ponyville has been a lot more interesting since then. <text:s/>Anyway, what brings you out here?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“A few things actually, but first I assume you&apos;ve heard that I took a lightning bolt last night and won?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Lyra snorted at that and said, “Yeah, though you wouldn&apos;t guess from the looks of you. <text:s/>From what I heard you got some serious air time as well. <text:s/>The town is split on whether you are some kind of super-pony, or some kind of monster. <text:s/>So, trying to be discrete is out the window, and from what it sounds like you are already being hunted. <text:s/>Ponies don&apos;t just get struck with lightning.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Wild mulled that over, “Well, whichever the town chooses they won&apos;t be wrong. <text:s/>Huh, adjusting to controlled weather is weird. <text:s/>You&apos;re theory is that there&apos;s a conspiracy to kill me.” <text:s/>Wild earned a slap on the shoulder for that, but just grinned and continued, “Any idea who?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Lyra sighed, “My guess is Martial&apos;s group, the <text:span text:style-name="T360">Frozen Bulwark</text:span>. <text:s/>An old group nearly from the founding of Equestria. <text:s/>They&apos;re pretty much pony supremacists, all that hostility had to go to something when the tree tribes united after all. <text:s/>Usually they focus on wild creatures, but they seem to have taken an interest in you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“They&apos;re aren&apos;t the only ones, Twilight and Fluttershy know about me, and the royal <text:span text:style-name="T329">guard</text:span> is al<text:span text:style-name="T329">so</text:span> poking around now.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Lyra laughed, “You haven&apos;t even been here a full week and already you&apos;ve got the attention of the royal guard. <text:s/>You are not very good at secrets, are you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“You have no idea, and I have no idea what I am doing.” Wild grumbled, “I was hoping you might have some insight.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Lyra rubbed her chin and mused, “Hmm, the town and royal guard will do their own thing, just don&apos;t be a bad pony and it should sort itself out. <text:s/>The <text:span text:style-name="T360">Bulwark</text:span> though are a problem. <text:s/>They are one of <text:soft-page-break/>the biggest problems for our group, I&apos;m conscripting you by the way, and we&apos;ve always just avoided them. <text:s/>You however are on a collision course with them and I don&apos;t know what will happen. <text:s/>I&apos;ve wanted to be more public with things but it was never worth the risk. <text:s/>You&apos;re going to be a trailblazer for us, I hope you&apos;re prepared for a fight.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Dropping her face into her hooves Wild groaned, “I&apos;m not a fighter, I just <text:span text:style-name="T329">happen to be very hard to kill</text:span>.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“That will have to be good enough, there aren&apos;t really many pony fighters to get experience from. <text:s/>Although Twilight has connections with the princess. <text:s/>You might be able to get a better solution there to this clandestine organization issue.” said Lyra as she picked up her lyre again. <text:s/>Lyra began playing and provided a nice background while Wild thought over all the new information. <text:s/>Giving into the soothing music Wild relaxed and watched the ponies in the park, until Lyra started packing up to leave.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“Oh, and there&apos;s a meeting in a couple days, I&apos;ll bring you along, OK?” <text:s/>Lyra asked. <text:s/>Wild agreed and Lyra headed off to her next destination. <text:s/>Not long after Lyra left a pair of young unicorns approached Wild stopping about a yard away.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P78"><text:span text:style-name="T147"><text:tab/>One of them began to whisper, “She doesn&apos;t look like a monster, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T148">just a blank flank</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T147">.” </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P78"><text:span text:style-name="T147"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T148">Maybe if we throw a rock at her she&apos;ll turn into a monster.” <text:s/>The other suggested.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P78"><text:span text:style-name="T148"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">Well they are straight forward at least, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T148">Wild thought, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">a bit dumb though. <text:s/>I hope they don&apos;t go monster hunting in the Everfree forest. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T148">The one that had made the suggestion had already found a rock and was returning. <text:s/>He threw it at Wild as soon as he made it back to his friend. <text:s text:c="2"/>Wild had no problem catching the rock before it hit her despite the fact that the kids had been behind her. <text:s/>Tossing the rock away, Wild got up and headed over to the pair of stunned foals.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“What are you two doing?” Wild demanded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“We heard that you were a monster in disguise.” <text:s/>The taller one answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“Yeah, we had to see. <text:s/>So can you show us?” <text:s/>The portly one added.<text:tab/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P78"><text:span text:style-name="T148"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">I feel sorry for their parents, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T148">Wild thought as she recovered from the idiocy. <text:s/>Wild decided to humor them, its not like anyone would believe these two. <text:s/>“Well, I suppose I am a shape shifter. Though I don&apos;t think that makes me a monster.” <text:s/>Wild corrected before shifting her eyes and teeth to a house cat version. <text:s/>“Alright there you go.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P45"><text:tab/>“Cool, she is a monster.” cheered the taller one.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P45"><text:tab/>“I know, I bet none of the other towns have their own monsters.” gushed the other one as the pair rushed off. <text:s/>Wild reverted her features.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P79"><text:span text:style-name="T148"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">Well, there they go to add more rumor to mill, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T148">Wild smirked, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">Should be enough </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T39">theories </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">now that no one will actually believe any of them. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T149">The day progressed uneventfully until the late afternoon. <text:s/>Wild had decided to stop at the fountain in the town square. She was sitting on the ground with her </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T149">back against the edge of the fountain when a pony walked near by and dropped an object in her lap. <text:s/>Looking down to see what it was she found a baseball sized metal ball with a lattice of grooves cut into it. <text:s/>One end of it had an extension with a mouth grip and lever clearly marking it as a grenade.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>“Oh fuck, its a bomb!” Wild yelled to the ponies still in the square and grabbed the grenade. <text:s/>Most were already home, so the square was mostly empty, but a few stragglers remained for one reason or another. <text:s/>“Everyone run away!” <text:s/>Wild ordered since not all of the townsfolk understood the first. <text:s/>That got them moving mostly in the right direction.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P79"><text:span text:style-name="T149"><text:tab/>S</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T39">hit this is going to hurt, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T149">Wild thought as she shoved the grenade down her throat. <text:s/>From the memories of an inattentive Blackwatch soldier she knew that the shrapnel would easily rip through the ponies still nearby. <text:s/>She went with the simplest solution using her own body to absorb the fragments. <text:s/>Just a second after the grenade hit her stomach it went off. <text:s/>The sound was only slightly muffled and caused all the ponies in the square to drop to the ground on instinct. <text:s/>The ones still in the square and closest to the fountain felt themselves get hit with something and warm liquid started trailing down their bodies, one got hit hard enough by one of the larger projectiles to have the breath knock out of her. <text:s/>At least one minute passed before anyone was willing to move.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>The first to see the scene were the guards despite not being present at the time. <text:s/>Most of them emptied their stomachs when they got their first glimpse. <text:s/>Unidentifiable bits of flesh were strewn over the square on one side of the fountain along with blood splatter. <text:s/>Unfortunately the ponies still in the square were not spared and would see that they too were covered in viscera once that stopped cowering. <text:s/>A few of the larger mass could be recognized as organ including the one that knocked the breath out of a mare. <text:s/>The worst part was Wild herself. <text:s/>Her entire chest cavity was missing only her ribs remaining. <text:s/>Her head was forced up by the blast and blood could be seen oozing out of the mouth as it limply rested on the fountains edge. <text:s/>Her limbs were mostly intact, though one foreleg hung by a thread and a hind leg was clearly bent the wrong way. <text:s/>Her ever present bags where the only thing untouched by the explosion</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>After recovering the guards helped the ponies around the square to the hospital. <text:s/>They left the body of the obviously dead mare at the center of the explosion. <text:s/>No hospital could do anything for her after all. <text:s/>As with all such events spectators began showing up and soon a ring of horrified ponies formed around the square kept back by some of the local guards. <text:s/>At the front of the crowd Wild&apos;s friends had gathered along with a cream color earth pony mare with a blue and pink mane. <text:s/>She had a trio of candies on her flank. <text:s/>They were all commenting about the tragedy except for Twilight Sparkle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>Twilight countered, “I don&apos;t think she&apos;s dead.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>Along with the crowd the nearest guard reasoned, “Ma&apos;am, I don&apos;t think any pony could survive missing all their organs.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>Twilight continued, “She isn&apos;t exactly a pony though, and this isn&apos;t the first time she&apos;s lost her organs.” <text:s/>Twilight managed to keep her lunch down as she guessed, “I think she&apos;s just disoriented, and will start moving again at some point.”</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>“Of course not. <text:s/>Zombies aren&apos;t real.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>While Twilight was arguing with the guard Wild was actually recovering just as Twilight said. <text:s/>First she fixed her senses but could only hear the surrounding ponies as her view was of the sky and she couldn&apos;t yet move her head. <text:s/>The first indication that ponies got of anything strange was a loud wet popping sound from Wild&apos;s hind leg popping back into place.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>“Well shoot, she really is moving again.” The guard with Twilight observed. <text:s/>All of the ponies had turned their attention to Wild including all of the guards. <text:s/>The watched as loose foreleg was pulled back into place, and her head reattached. <text:s/>She then decided to get to work collecting her various bits and stood up even though she was still missing an abdomen. <text:s/>She was stretching her legs when he caught sight of one pony trying to sneak away while the others stood there gaping. <text:s/>Narrowing her eyes, she yelled, “Hey you, where are you going?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81"><text:span text:style-name="T70"><text:tab/>Upon being called out the pony began running. <text:s/>Wild sprinted after him the crowd either ducking or diving out of her path. <text:s/>When she got to the edge of the crowd she jump over them and landed near the runner. <text:s/>She formed a needle at the edge of her hoof and loaded it with manticore venom. <text:s/>With a quickly jab to the flank the running pony was paralyzed and fell in a heap to the ground sliding a short distance. <text:s/>Calmly Wild tossed him on her back and returned to the fountain. <text:s/>The ponies wisely making way for her since they did not want to get in the way of what amounted to a large skeleton with some loose flesh carrying another pony. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T150">She set him down on a clean spot near the fountain and turned to survey the mess. <text:s/>W</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">ild elongated her tail and used it to sweep up the mess </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T150">scattered around the square</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"><text:tab/>Twilight was the first to recover. <text:s/>When Wild saw Twilight approach she sat down and let strands of her tail extend independently to finish cleaning. <text:s/>She did not remember to close her chest until Twilight made some vague gestures and developed a green tint.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>“Hey, Wild are you OK?” Twilight ventured coming to a stop right in front of Wild.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P80"><text:span text:style-name="T70"><text:tab/>Wild sighed, “I don&apos;t think I have been for years.” <text:s/>looking </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T150">around she lamented, “I thought I left all this behind. <text:s/>I can break down latter, this situation needs to be handled now.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49"><text:tab/>“Alright, but you really should talk to someone.” <text:s/>Twilight relented.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P82"><text:span text:style-name="T150"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T151">Seeing she had gotten all of her missing parts Wild retracted her tail back to a normal length. <text:s/>One of the guards, this one in a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T152">suit rather than armor, got her attention as he drawled, “I am </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T155">Colonel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T152"> Cobalt Might of the Ponyville guard I assume you have a good reason for attacking and subduing a pony.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"><text:tab/>“While literally everyone else was staring at me he was trying to sneak away. <text:s/>Struck me as pretty suspicious.” Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"><text:tab/>“Can you revive him?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P82"><text:span text:style-name="T152"><text:tab/>“Yes, you want him now.” Wild offered and once the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T155">Colonel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T152"> agreed, went to remove the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T152">paralysis. <text:s/>Doing the same as she did to paralyze him but using the antidote instead the stallion was moving in just a few seconds. <text:s/>He did not try to escape knowing it would be foolish, but he did decide to start talking.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81"><text:span text:style-name="T152"><text:tab/>“We will strike you down, monster.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T153">he declared, “It&apos;s only a matter of time now, we will not stop.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“What, I&apos;m a monster just because I&apos;m not a normal pony?” retorted Wild, “I think the one who dropped a bomb in the middle of town is more of a monster!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“Sacrifices must be made. <text:s/>We shall not suffer a monster to live.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81"><text:span text:style-name="T153"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T154">Enough you two.” Cobalt ordered, “Someone put this stallion in a cell.” <text:s/>He paused to make sure that the order was followed before continuing, “And you Miss Way what exactly are you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/>“A shape shifter,” <text:s/>she replied watching the stallion being led away, “the only name I&apos;ve ever heard being &apos;prototype&apos;.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/>“And Miss Sparkle since you don&apos;t seem surprised, can I assume you know her and that she is a shape shifter?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P82"><text:span text:style-name="T154"><text:tab/>“Yes </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T155">Colonel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T154">.” Twilight answered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81"><text:span text:style-name="T154"><text:tab/>“Alright, good enough for me, towns had stranger things wander in just don&apos;t cause problems Miss Way. <text:s/>Now, I want to know why you blew up.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T155">Wild recounted the recent events in the square to the Colonel. <text:s/>Afterwards the Colonel asked, “Where are the fragments of the device, we didn&apos;t recover any of them?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/>Wild took said fragments out of her bag and explained, “They all ended up in embedded inside me, that should be all of them.” <text:s/>She offered them to the Colonel, but he had one of his men collect them in an evidence bag.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81"><text:span text:style-name="T155"><text:tab/>“Would you be willing to do a quick question and answer session.” <text:s/>The Colonel asked watching the ponies milling around the edge of the square, “I imagine it might put ponies at ease or at least prevent them from using their imaginations.” <text:s/>Wild agreed and both she and Cobalt stood before the towns ponies. <text:s/>Cobalt announced, “Towns ponies as I&apos;m sure you noticed there has been an attack here only an hour ago. <text:s/>The assailant dropped an explosive device next to Miss Wild Way. <text:s/>Due to her unorthodox actions she was the only one seriously injured by the device. <text:s/>We are investigating the matter, but the likely assailant has already been arrested. <text:s/>Many of you are probably wondering how Wild Way is now fine despite having the majority of her body obliterated less than an hour ago. <text:s/>That is why I have asked her to give a small introduction and accept questions from you.” <text:s/>Cobalt stood back and allowed Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T156">introduce herself.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P81"><text:span text:style-name="T156"><text:tab/>“Hello, I am Wild Way and as many of you likely saw, I am not exactly a normal pony. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T157">I am actually a shape shifter which also allows me to keep my body alive even after otherwise lethal amounts of damage. <text:s/>So, what do you want to know?” <text:s/>Wild explained to the ponies. <text:s/>Once she finished they burst into cacophony of questions.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“Quiet all of you, one question at a time. <text:s/>She can&apos;t answer if y&apos;all are talking over each other.” Cobalt yelled rolling his eyes at the group of supposed adult ponies. <text:s/>The session proceeded in an orderly fashion from there.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T326">Are you an alien</text:span>?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T326">Yes, I was summoned here, but I don&apos;t know why.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T326">So</text:span> you<text:span text:style-name="T326">&apos;re</text:span> an alien invader?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“No, I was summoned here. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T326">Nothing on my original planet could send me here</text:span>.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“What do you eat?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T326">I can eat most anything, preferably desserts</text:span>.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“What&apos;s your favorite flavor?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“Chocolate”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“You&apos;ve been lying bout being a pony, why should we trust you now?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T326">I&apos;m a shape shifter, I don&apos;t have a &apos;true&apos; form so I went with an Earth pony one. <text:s/>If wanting to fit in easier makes me a liar then so be it, but I never insisted I was a pony, nor did I really try hard to keep it secret.</text:span>”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T326">Ya been tricking ponies, I say that&apos;s lying.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T326">I would be surprised if you didn&apos;t have your own secrets, but I guess we will ust have to agree to disagree on this point.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“Ya said you can eat anything, does that include ponies?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T326">I do eat meat, so I guess so. <text:s/>Not that I intend to try, the Everfree forest has worked just fine for food</text:span>.” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T326">answered Wild dreading the reaction. <text:s/>The ponies began murmuring among themselves some now fearful, while others pointed out that if anything Wild would discourage Everfree predators. <text:s/>The questions quickly tapered off with so many muling over the last answer. <text:s/>By the end of the questions Wild was emotionally exhausted and ready to find a place to collapse into sleep. <text:s/>Twilight was the first to get to her and practically demanded she sleep over. <text:s/>Saying good bye to her other friends she went with Twilight. <text:s/>She was too tired to even worry about Spike&apos;s fire breath and just flopped onto a couch her face buried in the cushion.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P105" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 8</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T326">Wild woke when she felt a nudge to her shoulder, but decided to remain still and hope it would go away. <text:s/>Instead the nudging became full on shaking, and calling her name. <text:s/>To ward off her attacker she told them to go away though it lost its effect as the couch cushion muffled her words. <text:s/>Finally her attacker relented with a huff and she could return to sleeping.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T327">Fine, stay asleep, but I&apos;m still bringing you downstairs regardless.” her attacker declared. <text:s/></text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T327">Before Wild fully considered the words she felt a pull on her tail and ended up face down on the floor. <text:s/>She merely groaned as she was dragged along.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T327">Three ponies and a dragon watched as Flitter slowly pulled a lump of pony into the room by the tail. <text:s/>Dropping her burden in the middle of the room Flitter also flopped onto the floor.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T327">You weigh a ton Wild,” Flitter puffed out, “What have you been eating?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T327">A manticore.” Wild mumbled as she reluctantly looked around the room, “I guess my plan to ignore the world until goes away is vetoed.” <text:s/>Seated around the room were Twilight, Spike, Lyra, and Lucent with Flitter catching her breath. <text:s/>Wild addressed the group around her, “So why is such an eclectic group waiting for me?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T327">We&apos;re worried about you,” Twilight pleaded, “After yesterday&apos;s... events you seemed pretty upset, and it is the second time that someone tried to kill you. <text:s/>We want to help, but you need to talk to us.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T327">Wild went to tell them that she was fine, but stopped. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T40">I said that wasn&apos;t true yesterday, and it&apos;s still not true today, <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T158">Wild realized looking down at her hooves, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T40">Well nothing ventured nothing gained.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T158"> “It&apos;s not that they tried to kill me, I&apos;ve lived with the threat of death for so long I&apos;m to jaded for it to be a problem. <text:s/>It&apos;s the method, and their attitude to it. <text:s/>He used a bomb in the middle of a populated area, on some level he considered all of the ponies there acceptable losses.” <text:s/>Wild paused to collect her thoughts <text:s/>and remarked, “You know even if I was the monster, I still found ponies trying to be heroes and stop me to be comforting.” <text:s/>Wild&apos;s mood to a sudden drop when she seethed, “I hate the idea of acceptable losses. <text:s/>My home was an acceptable loss, my parents were an acceptable loss, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T159">all of my friends were acceptable losses, I was an accepta--” A sudden crack interrupt her and she felt something impact the inside of her cheek. <text:s/>Using a hoof she pulled a partial tooth from her mouth and stared at it. <text:s/>She had </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T195">managed to</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T159"> grit her teeth hard enough to crack them. <text:s/>Deciding that was a good cue to calm down she finished with, “And that&apos;s why I was upset yesterday.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>The rest of the ponies in the room took a while longer to process the information they had just received. <text:s/>Wild soon found herself part of a pony pile the only ones not included being Spike and Lucent. <text:s/>Once the girls separated Twilight declared, “You don&apos;t need to worry, Equestria&apos;s a pretty safe place, and the ponies that keep attacking you will be stopped.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>“Thanks girls, it is nice to having someone to talk to.” Wild confessed some moisture still in her eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T159"><text:tab/>“Unfortunately, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T160">we still need to talk about the attack as well as your paperwork Miss Way.” Lucent announced once everyone had recomposed themselves.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T160"><text:tab/>“Well the attack was straight forward. <text:s/>A pony dropped a fragmentation grenade in my lap, I ate it to suppress the damage, and the results were pretty dramatic. <text:s text:c="2"/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T161">That pony also decided to stay in the crowd, I guess to see if the explosive worked, but I caught him when he tried to sneak away.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“What about Martial Bravery what do you know of him?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T161"><text:tab/>“He started stalking me the first day I arrived and referred to me as an &apos;undead abomination&apos;. <text:s/>I assume he&apos;s with the bomber pony and that they were set off by my lack of a cutie mark.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T162">Wild mused, “I guess they weren&apos;t too far off, technically I have died and come back.” <text:s/>That got a few quirked eyebrows.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/>“What do you mean by that?”<text:tab/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T162"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T163">I was infected and as with every one else infected by this virus, my entire body was consumed and remade for the virus&apos; purposes. <text:s/>The only odd part was that my mind somehow made it through to the other end </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T164">intact.” <text:s/>Wild shrugge</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T165">d before laughing at the other ponies leaning away. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T166">Unlike the ponies Spike was leaning forward paying rapt attention. <text:s/>Wild assured, “Don&apos;t worry you&apos;re not at risk of becoming zombies.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59"><text:tab/>Flitter interjected, “Just what the <text:span text:style-name="T361">hay</text:span> happened to you<text:span text:style-name="T361">r</text:span> home?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T166"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T169">Alright, I guess I can tell you about my home</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T166">,” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T167">Wild said as all attention was on her,</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T166"> “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T167">Well, the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T166">moderately terrible part </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T167">at least</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T166">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T167">Fortunately for me the first 17 or so years of my life were normal. <text:s/>I went to school, had sleep overs, friends, all that normal teenage girl stuff. <text:s/>Then a virus was released and my world basically ended. <text:s/>Within a day the part of the city I lived in became a disaster zone, thousands already dead, and more joining them at a frightening rate. <text:s/>The only silver line being that part of the city was on an island and was quarantined quickly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T167"><text:tab/>Wild took a breath before continuing, “I learned all of this later, but the virus that was released was not natural it was created by a black ops group called Blackwatch. <text:s/>They would handle things the government wanted done, but didn&apos;t want to be connected to like assassination, or terrorist operations in foreign countries. <text:s/>The started with the goal of taking the worst missions to protect everyone else from having to even know about them. <text:s/>By the time of the disaster they had shifted to a goal of protecting the nation at any cost, even having to sacrifice part of a city and the millions living there. <text:s/>They didn&apos;t even try to save anyone since we knew too much and could harm Blackwatch if we survived.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60"><text:tab/>At this point Wild eyes were focused on some distant point and her voice had lost all emotion as her words spilled out, “Blackwatch also doubled as a weapons research facility. <text:s/>Terrible weapons designed to kill as <text:span text:style-name="T348">efficiently</text:span> as possible which is where the virus came from. <text:s/>It was intended to be a weapon of mass destruction to destroy &apos;problematic&apos; cities quickly and quietly. <text:s/>It was supposed ot spread throughout the population rapidly and have a 100 percent fatality rate. <text:s/>They got close, it killed everything in its path, but it had the nasty habit of reviving them as monstrous carriers of the disease. <text:s/>Basically a zombie apocalypse that was neither discrete nor controllable.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60"><text:tab/>Wild had refocused on Lucent, but her tone remained lifeless, “I assume you will report this part to the Princess, its probably best she know. <text:s/>To be clear, I am essentially a walking plague. <text:s/>I could infect everything around me and cause a pandemic. <text:s/>I find the very thought of letting this virus run wild abhorrent so as long as I am alive that&apos;s not going to happen. <text:s/>I&apos;ve already lost everyone and everything I loved once, I&apos;m not about to let that happen again. <text:s/>Also, I was captured by Blackwatch and developed <text:s/>some neurosis from that. <text:s/>One of them being a fear of being captured again, so if that was being considered please don&apos;t. <text:s/>It will end poorly, its just a question of how poorly.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“I hope thats not a threat.” Lucent accused with narrowed eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T167"><text:tab/>Wild was just glad to be on another topic and answered, “No, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T168">I basically have a whole collection of phobias including a fear of being trapped. <text:s/>I&apos;m not sure what that one is called.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P61"><text:tab/>“Cleithrophobia.” Twilight supplied automatically.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P61"><text:tab/>“I have cleithrophobia,” Wild repeated, ”so if I get trapped I am compelled to find a way out. <text:s/>If I can&apos;t get out then I will try harder until something breaks, possibly myself even. <text:s/>Its not a matter of trying to be difficult I would literally go crazy otherwise.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P61"><text:tab/>Lucent sighed, “You are going to be a constant source of headaches aren&apos;t you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P61"><text:tab/>Wild chuckled, “You aren&apos;t the first to say that, but yes I will.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T168"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T169">I don&apos;t suppose you would be willing to not use this virus?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“No, that not really possible. <text:s/>Like I told Twilight I am technically a viral gestalt. <text:s/>The virus produces some sort of telepathic hive mind and for the strain contained within me my mind has had the dubious honor of becoming the hive mind. <text:s/>I cannot avoid using the virus anymore than a pony can avoid using their brain.” Wild explained before adding, “Though some seem to be giving it a good attempt.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“Wait your telepathic?” Flitter asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“I can only read my own mind,” Wild answered, “though it does mean that I can control my body even if its in multiple parts. <text:s/>That&apos;s pretty disorienting, so I try to avoid that.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“Do you have any other abilities aside from shape shifting and a hive mind?” Lucent asked writing something in a notebook he pulled from his armor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T169"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T170">I can infect things too, but that just listing them is pretty misleading.” <text:s/>Wild elaborated, “When I infect something it becomes part of me since the hive mind will expand to include it. <text:s/>The part you will most likely be interested in is that I assimilate everything biological from what I infect. <text:s/>That includes the genetics, physical characteristics like scars, and memories.” <text:s/>Wild paused as she watched the implication sink in. <text:s/>Lucent, Twilight, and Lyra all had their ears pulled back, and the color drained from their faces. <text:s/>Spike and Flitter were mostly unaffected since they were only considering personal implications. <text:s/>Wild continued, “I can see you realize just how serious of a threat that could be which is why I also want to tell you Blackwatch&apos;s solution. <text:s/>They made viral detectors and while its not a perfect solution it is effective. <text:s/>I can&apos;t really go anywhere without virus after all. <text:s/>The last thing is that my shape shifting is actually perfect control of every cell in my body on a genetic level meaning I can reproduce traits from any DNA I consume. <text:s/>I can also mix and match stuff as much as I want.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“You are being oddly forthcoming.” <text:s/>Lucent commented while continuing to write everything down, “Distressingly so. <text:s/>I would think you might keep those kinds of abilities secret.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>Wild blushed at that and mumbled, “I&apos;m not very good at keeping secrets. <text:s/>Pathologically incapable of it really.” <text:s/>Her voice regained a normal volume as she continued, “I figure its better to just <text:soft-page-break/>get it out of the way quickly and to be the one to do it. <text:s/>I also hope providing the beginnings of a solution will help smooth things over.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“Wait, you said pathologically,” Twilight questioned, “how can you be pathologically incapable of keeping a secret?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T170"><text:tab/>The effect of that question was subtle, but left the ponies unnerved with the impression that death had just passed them by. <text:s/>Wild had stammered, “Answer the question and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T172">it doesn&apos;t get worse</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T170">.” as her coat and eyes lost their vibrancy </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T171">before she just stopped. <text:s/>Twilight was the first to do anything when she approached Wild. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T172">She could she Wild&apos;s lips moving but no sounds was produced. <text:s/>Then Twilight noticed why there was a lack of noise. <text:s/>There was no air to speak with since Wild had stopped breathing. <text:s/>Twilight also checked for a pulse and found none. <text:s/>Unfortunately she did not know what to do and started her own panic attack by pacing and mumbling incoherently.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>Lyra ended up being the one to step up and bring the situation back under control. <text:s/>Drawing in a breath she asked, “Hey Wild, what would you like for breakfast?” <text:s/>She received four completely different reaction in quick succession.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>“Bacon!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>“What?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>“That worked!?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>Twilight just bleated and fell over.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>“Not quite.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T172"><text:tab/>Wild look around in confusion before her memory set to work. <text:s/>Her ears folded back as she said, “Ah, I&apos;m sorry. <text:s/>That topic is still a little raw and I would like to avoid it for now. <text:s/>The surface of it is that I was captured and &apos;interrogated&apos; by Blackwatch. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T173">Suffice it to say t</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T172">hat has left a lasting impression and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T173">I can&apos;t leave question unanswered</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T172">.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T172"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T173">Before anyone else could Lucent interjected, “I think I slight change of subject is in order.” <text:s/>Digging around in his armor he pulled a small packet of papers </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T174">out and passed them over to Wild and explained, “Here is a naturalization form for you. <text:s/>Please fill it out as best you can and then once filed you will officially be an Equestrian citizen.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>Glad for the distraction Wild began filling the papers out. <text:s/>The rest of the ponies also relaxed from the recent storm of emotion letting all the new information settle. <text:s/>The papers were just a standard request for naturalization and Wild quickly filled out the parts she could, but ran into a few problems.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>“Um, what should I put for species... and gender for that matter.” Wild asked, “I can change both of those at will.”<text:tab/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>“Just put which ever gender you want, but for the species something unique.” <text:s/>Lucent answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>“Alright, female Blacklight pony then.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“A Blacklight pony?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>“Blacklight was the viruses codename and I intend to stay more or less a pony.” Wild shrugged before moving onto the next unanswered question. <text:s/>Wild said, “Um, I don&apos;t really have a place of residence.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>“Where have you been living?” Lyra asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>“Just around town, I don&apos;t need to sleep and there&apos;s plenty of food wandering around in the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Also, I&apos;m more durable than the average house, so I don&apos;t have a pressing ned for a house.” Wild explained.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>“I&apos;ll make a note to check what the princess wants to do, for now just leave it blank.” Lucent said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>Wild worried about her next question as she asked, “So, how much of a problem is it that I may have murdered around a dozen people?” <text:s/>That got a reaction as everyone scooted away from her except Twilight who was still insensate.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T174"><text:tab/>“Alright, another note for the princess then.” Lucent </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T175">sighed and took the papers once Wild had finished writing. <text:s/>Adding his own notes plus a couple new ones Lucent neatly gathered the papers into a single pile. <text:s/>He then turned to Spike and requested, “Spike would you send these to Princess Celestia, please?” <text:s/>Shortly the papers were whisked off as a puff of smoke and the two males noticed a missing pony. <text:s/>Flitter and Lyra were starring mouths agape at one of the walls, but Wild was no where to be found. <text:s/>Twilight had rolled over and begun snoring so everyone knew where she was. <text:s/>Lucent inquired, “Where did Wild Way go?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83"><text:span text:style-name="T175"><text:tab/>Lyra pointed at the wall, but Lucent only saw a wooden support column resembling a log. <text:s/>Thinking a bit he realized why that was odd, the library was built inside a tree. <text:s/>It did not have any columns with bark on the outside. <text:s/>Walking over he knocked on the log not really expecting anything in particular. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T176">Instead a pair of eyes opened in front of him and the log whispered, “Is the fire gone?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66"><text:tab/>“Yes, there is no more fire.” Lucent replied, “Unless you have something else you need I think I am going to check in with the local garrison.” <text:s/>Lucent began walking away and was soon out of the building.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66"><text:tab/>“I think he&apos;s a little high strung.” Lyra commented.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66"><text:tab/>Flitter looked around at the ponies that were still present. <text:s/>Spike had wandered off after sending the papers, and Twilight was only technically present in the physical sense. <text:s/>Flitter realized something and worried, “Am I one of the crazy ponies now?” Lyra&apos;s laughing was not the response she was hoping for.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P114" text:outline-level="2">Chapter 9</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P84"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T328">The rest of the day was spent lounging around town after the recent events for Wild. <text:s/>During the night she decided to go on another walk through the forest to see what she could find. <text:s/>She would </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T328">welcome another manticore, but her real target was much smaller. <text:s/>She was looking for a spider to explore the possibilities of spider silk. She did manage to find a few species of spiders after hours of looking, but not much else since she stayed near to the edge of the forest.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P84"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T328">Now that she had a good collection of spider genes it was time to experiment. <text:s/>In this case that amounted to creating a huge mess with globs and filaments of spider webbing covering herself and much of the surrounding flora. <text:s/>Her persistence payed off as she figured out how to consistently make silk fibers without sticking parts of the forest to her body. <text:s/>Working from there she tried adding more spinnerets rather than making them larger and succeeded in making strands large enough to support her weight. <text:s/>She considered the possible marketing opportunities, but first she had much more important business.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P84"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T328">While she was experimenting an observer had shown up hiding in a tree. <text:s/>The darkness and leaf cover did next to nothing in blocking Wild&apos;s sonar. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T41">This is getting ridiculous, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T177">she fumed, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T41">can&apos;t a girl get some privacy. <text:s/>At least I&apos;m not subjected to most biologically needs or I would really be pissed. Heh. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T177">One more practice session and her plans were complete. <text:s/>She could now launch her ropes, meaning there was only one reasonable course of action.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P84"><text:span text:style-name="T177"><text:tab/>“Spidermare. <text:s/>Spidermare, doing whatever a Spidermare can.” <text:s/>She sang </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T178">as she swung from branch to branch sing her spider silk as a grapple. <text:s/>Her spectator did not follow either because of her speed, shear surprise at her actions, or scare at the fact she had run into several trees. <text:s/>The trees were obliterated before being consumed in an unintentional display of raw power. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T179">Approaching the tree line she built up as much speed as she could and swung up into the air. <text:s/>Reaching a height well above the canopy when she launched out of the forest she went into a series somersaults. <text:s/>She stuck the landing with a shower dirt and loud ground shaking thud. <text:s/>Of course, had she been anyone else landing on her head with that much force would have been a lot worse. <text:s/>Wild walked away with just a headache and the knowledge that her enthusiasm outpaced her skills in gymnastics.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P115"><text:tab/>Walking through town was a little tense. <text:s/>None of the ponies did anything overt, but a few would watch Wild longer than necessary, particularly when foals were around. <text:s/>There was also a conspicuous bubble around her that ponies would either avoid or hurry out of. <text:s/>Annoyed, she decided that the best solution would be exposure therapy and parked herself in the middle of the town square. <text:s/>The towns ponies would either get used to her, or just have to avoid the middle of town forever. <text:s/>That plan lasted until Lyra showed up to bring Wild to her first club meeting.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P115"><text:tab/>The club meeting was held in town hall and a couple dozen ponies already present when the pair walked in. <text:s/>Lyra got a few greetings, but Wild ended up with the most attention. <text:s/>In contrast to the general population, the ponies here were eager to meet her and swarmed around in a cacophony of greetings. <text:s/>Lyra had made her way to the front of the room to stand on a stage. <text:s/>Once enough time had passed she called for attention and all of the ponies found their way to a palce in front of the stage.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T179"><text:tab/>“Welcome </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T180">fellow Conspiracy Hunters</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T179">, let&apos;s get this meeting started. <text:s/>We have some </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T180">urgent new developments which is why I called this emergency meeting. <text:s/>First though we have a new member with us today. <text:s/>She&apos;s even the source of the developments. <text:s/>Everyone welcome Wild Way, our brand new </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T180">resident alien shape shifter.” Lyra pontificated clearly enjoying being a ham. <text:s/>Wild stood up at that and waved to the crowd. <text:s/>There was a decent amount of clapping and greetings, but the one that Wild noticed the most were the smiles on the ponies faces. <text:s/>They were clearly excited for this new development, and not even remotely worried about her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P116"><text:tab/>Wild was having a surprisingly hard time grasping the concept that these ponies knew what she was, but were not freaking out. <text:s/>She even ventured, “None of you look worried about me.” She faltered, “I...”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T180"><text:tab/>Seeing the beginning of tears the nearest mare to Wild drew her into a hug, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T181">rather impressive since Wild weighed at least twice as much as the mare. <text:s/>“Come here dear, you&apos;re among friends.” the mare cooed. <text:s text:c="2"/>Every time Wild tried to protest the mare just silenced her until Wild gave in a relaxed into the hug. <text:s/>“It doesn&apos;t matter what you are here, everyone here is capable of terrible things. <text:s/>We are all well aware that just because you can do something doesn&apos;t mean you will.” <text:s/>Wild just cried on the mare&apos;s shoulder as she realized that maybe her tribulations would end.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P117"><text:tab/>Breaking the hug, and wiping her face Wild croaked, “I guess after spending years in a war zone, sometimes I forget that there can be nice people.” <text:s/>That concept surprised the entire room, war happens occasionally, but there had not been a war lasting years in centuries.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P117"><text:tab/>One curious stallion asked, “What were they fighting over for so long?” <text:s/>He received a few glares for that and shrunk back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T181"><text:tab/>Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T197">gave a humourless</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T181"> chuckled, “The world I come from is much more violent from what I&apos;ve seen, the conflict only spanned a fifth of the city it was in. <text:s/>As for the reasons, it was two groups of monsters fighting. <text:s/>One wanted to remake everyone in their own image. <text:s/>The process they used was much less pleasant than that sounds. <text:s/>The other group wanted to cover up the whole thing, and also had a penchant for doing experiments on civilians stuck in the area. <text:s/>They really didn&apos;t want it known that they had created the first group and lost control of it.” <text:s/>Conversation died down after that allowing Lyra to retake control of the meeting.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T181"><text:tab/>“The next order of business, unfortunately is the confirmation of our worst suspicions. <text:s/>The </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T209">Bulwark</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T181"> are targeting Wild Way to point that they risked the lives of towns ponies that happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. <text:s/>Thank Wild for your quick thinking, that attack could have been much worse.” <text:s/>Lyra lamented taking a moment before continuing, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T182">As well there has been a cases of spying, stabbing, and possibly weaponized lightning. <text:s/>The only reason this hasn&apos;t been a case of murder, is because Wild Way is nigh immortal.” <text:s/>Wild shrugged and confirmed it, not much short of complete cellular death would actually kill her. <text:s/>Lyra asserted, “This is not acceptable, we need to do something. <text:s/>I think it is time to start working a plan to reveal ourselves. <text:s/>I have the least risk though, so what do all of you think?” <text:s/>Murmurs spread throughout the crowd, until the mare sitting next to Wild offered her support. <text:s/>Even though her support was tentative it still got gasp from many of the ponies.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T182"><text:tab/>“It is quite an exciting time, but the actions against Wild Way prove at least one thing beyond a doubt. <text:s/>The </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T209">Frozen Bulwark</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T182"> are not something we can play around with, and there will be no second chances with them in any sens of the phrase.” <text:s/>the mare proclaimed. <text:s/>Now that she was not crying Wild </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T182">got a good look at the mare. <text:s/>She had a coat a shade lighter green than Wild&apos;s, but her mane was much more distinctive. <text:s/>It was braided all the way down her neck, thin streaks of white hair running through the vibrant red that made up the bulk. <text:s/>The distinct lines on her face were the only hint of age, otherwise she appeared as a mare in her prime. <text:s/>Her flank was adorned by a single rose bud. <text:s/>The mare continued speaking, “We cannot afford to be discovered by them, but we cannot simply stay the course and hope that we don&apos;t get revealed. <text:s/>Instead, we need to reveal our selves on our own terms.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P118"><text:tab/>The crowd started debating the issue but it was clear they would not reach an agreement. <text:s/>This was more to brainstorm ideas than to come up with a ready to go plan anyway. <text:s/>Wild waited for them to agree to disagree before she asked, “Hey, I know what species Lyra is, but what about everyone else?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T182"><text:tab/>“We forgot to do the introductions.” Lyra groaned, “You have already met our resident blood sucker, Doctor Humor the vampire.” <text:s/>He stood and bowed. “The wolfpony twins Shepherd and Collie </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T183">run a pet shop in town.” <text:s/>a mare and stallion waved. <text:s/>“And everyone else is a love bug with Rose as the Ponyville changeling queen.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P119"><text:tab/>“What&apos;s a changeling?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P119"><text:tab/>Instead of Lyra the mare next to Wild, Rose spoke up, “We are a race of shape shifter that consume love. <text:s/>While being more or less ponies, we do have many insectoid traits. <text:s/>Lyra has decided that we are love bugs because of this.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T183"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T184">How does one consume love?” Wild asked perplexed by the concept.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P120"><text:tab/>“Technically the love is a catalyst for siphoning energy, but saying we eat love is easier.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T330">What does an insectoid pony look like anyway?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T330">Well, I&apos;ll show you mine if you show me yours.” Rose grinned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T330">I... Alright, I can show you a larger version of what I originally looked like.” Wild spluttered at the innuendo. <text:s/>She reared up and let a swarm of black tendrils break down her pony form. <text:s/>Within just a few seconds a 7 foot tall woman appeared with the muscular build of an amazon. <text:s/>She even made a pair of jeans and green shirt that looked brand new. <text:s/>A pack was slung across her shoulder since saddle bags would not work for a human. <text:s/>Her hair stretched half way down her back this time and she absently ran her fingers through it. <text:s/>“Huh, I forgot how nice fingers are.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T331">I did not expect you to be bipedal. <text:s/>You are quite pretty as you are though, but where did the clothes come from?” <text:s/>Rose admired as she and the rest of the ponies came closer to get a good look.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T331">Part of the shape shifting, they are actually made from modified hair essentially.” <text:s/>Wild explained before removing her bag, “Fully detachable too.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T331">That is an impressive ability,” Rose admitted, “My turn then.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T331">Wait, don&apos;t...” Lyra tried to warn just now remembering how changeling transformation worked. <text:s/>Unfortunately she was too late and Rose burst in to green flames. <text:s/>They burned away her current form, and left just as quickly to reveal a large black form. <text:s/>Rose still had the basic equine shape, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T331">but was covered in black chitin instead of fur. <text:s/>Circling her torso was a green band, and her back had a pink saddle shaped plate on it. <text:s/>Her mane was also pink and a long horn jutted out from the center of her forehead. <text:s/>The biggest change was her height, she was about twice the height of a pony and reached Wild&apos;s current height with the tip of her horn. <text:s/>On top of her head was a trio of antennae that resembled a crown.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T332">Wild was still caught up in the fiery display. <text:s/>Seeing someone else burst into flames managed to confuse her phobia since she was equally afraid of losing someone to fire as she was of the fire itself. <text:s/>In the end the fire was completely gone before she could reach a decision on how to act. <text:s/>Her first action after seeing a blackened figure that was just aflame was to immediately grab Rose and inspect the damage going so far as to lift her from the ground. <text:s/>“You&apos;re not burnt?” she hesitated now seeing that Rose was covered in chitin and not charred, “but you were just on fire.” <text:s/>Wild was frozen trying to figure out this puzzle.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T332">I forgot that she was deathly afraid of fire.” Lyra confessed to Rose.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T332">Well, this is a strange predicament but I&apos;ve been in worse.” Rose replied from her position in Wild&apos;s hands, “She certainly is a strong one though. <text:s/>Not many could just casually pick up a changeling queen.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T332">Wild brain had finished processing and reached the conclusion that she had an unharmed and adorable new creature. <text:s/>She drew the changeling into a hug and cooed, “You&apos;re adorable.” <text:s/>Everyone one in the room stopped as they tried to understand the alien in their midst, particularly the disguised changelings that had moved to rescue their queen.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T332">I think that is the first time anyone has described us as adorable,” Rose perplexed, “but could you let me down, this is a bit of an awkward position.” <text:s/>Wild did so and blushed after reviewing her recent actions.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T332">&apos;m Sorry, I got caught up in the moment” Wild apologized, “but how are you not burned at all.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T332">Changelings are immune to fire, and other chemical reactions for that matter. <text:s/>Their magic prevents them from being forcefully transformed, which includes such reactions.” Lyra lectured.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T332">You&apos;re immune to fire, too.” <text:s/>Wild beamed eyes sparkling in her admiration, “Changelings are awesome.” <text:s/>As if worried that speaking to loud would break something Wild whispered, “What about detached pieces of chitin, are those fireproof?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T333">Head tilted to the side Rose answered, “I don&apos;t actually know, it&apos;s never been tested before.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T333">Undeterred Wild continued, “Can we try, I can make a piece? <text:s/>I just need a DNA sample.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T333">You are strangely obsessed with this,” Rose relented, “but now I&apos;m curious too. <text:s/>What does it take for a DNA sample?” <text:s/>Wild explained the process and gave Rose one of the water canteens from her bag. <text:s/>Rose rinsed with it, and spit the water back in before returning it. <text:s/>A few seconds after replacing the canteen, Wild pulled a small sheet of chitin out to the surprise of her spectators. <text:s/>Rose marveled, “I am slightly surprised that worked. <text:s/>I can&apos;t help but wonder what one of the Canterlot </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T333">Universities would make of this.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T333">Wild had already hidden in on a second floor balcony just peeking over the edge. <text:s/>Lyra was able to provide the needed fire for the test. <text:s/>It turned out that the chitin was not immune to fire like it would be on a changeling, but it held up until rock melting temperatures. <text:s/>That was good enough for Wild, and changeling chitin became her single favorite material. <text:s/>Wild and Rose returned to their normal forms, though Wild used a changeling variant for fur and hair. <text:s/>The rest of ponies wandered off since the meeting was finished, but both Rose and Wild remained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T333">Wild have you given any thought to getting a house in Ponyville?” <text:s/>Rose inquired as the two mares trotted down the street.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T333">Not really, I couldn&apos;t afford to for so long I just forgot it was something I could do.” <text:s/>Wild explained with a growing smile, “Now that you brought it up it would be nice to have a place to call my own. <text:s/>I would have to build my own...” she gulped, “or it might be burned down.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T334">Well, I don&apos;t know if you are interested, but I actually have an available plot of land just inside the Everfree forest.” <text:s/>Rose offered, “Most ponies would not be even remotely interested in such a location, but I imagine it wouldn&apos;t be a problem for you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T334">It wouldn&apos;t.” Wild confirmed, but quirked an eyebrow as she challenged, “You have an ulterior motive though, why else would you just offer me something like that, or own land in the forest for that matter?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T334">True,” Rose said, “owned was perhaps not the right word. <text:s/>My group has special needs and as such needs a place to handle those. <text:s/>We are also somewhat secretive so the Everfree forest was our choice. <text:s/>Its reputation would keep the nosy away, and there is plenty of space as the entire thing is essentially unclaimed. <text:s/>However, the forest is dangerous, and with the recent activity our fighting ability leaves something to be desired. <text:s/>I was-”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T334">You want me to be a meat-shield for you.” Wild interrupted. <text:s text:c="2"/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T42">I should probably feel insulted by this, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T185">Wild wondered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T42">but it does present an opportunity. <text:s/>Not like its different from what I would be doing anyway.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T42"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T185">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T186">That&apos;s not how I would have said it,” Rose placated, “but yes...”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T186"><text:tab/>“Hmm” Wild drew out letting Rose linger in uncertainty. <text:s/>The pair had stopped at the edge of town and Wild even brought a hoof to her chin. <text:s/>She countered, “Alright, but on a few conditions. <text:s/>First, I will defer any legal, or political issues to you should they arise. <text:s/>Second, I want you to provide the building materials for me. <text:s/>And the last one is a bit strange.” <text:s/>Reaching into her bag Wild pulled out what appeared to be an ordinary rock </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T187">the size of a small cat</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T186"> and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T187">forced</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T186"> her face to remain emotionless </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T187">as she </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T186">said, “I want you to take care of my pet rock.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T186"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T187">Rose just blinked at those requests while Wild patiently waited. <text:s/>Eventually Rose collected wits and asked, “The first two I can understand where you are coming from, but why in the world would you need me to take care of a pet rock?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P121"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>Wild grinned, “It&apos;s not actually a rock, though a pet rock is about what it amounts too for the most part. <text:s/>It&apos;s actually a backup plan or me, and is alive. <text:s/>All I need you to do with it is find some safe spot to keep it thats open the outside air. <text:s/>It does eat, but spores and dust from the air will be enough for it.” <text:s/>Seeing that Rose had tilted her head and had not responded Wild went on, “Well, should it be relevant I would need about 100 tons of organic matter for building material. <text:s/>Doesn&apos;t really matter where it comes from.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T187"><text:tab/>“You are one strange mare, but I can agree to those terms. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T188">Let me show you the spot.” Rose agreed and took the &apos;pet rock&apos; from Wild before asking, “When you say organic matter does the state its in matter.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85"><text:span text:style-name="T188"><text:tab/>“Nope, raw sewage would be fine, but I hope you don&apos;t have that much sewage just laying around.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T189">The two mares head off to see the location, it was not a far walk as it was the closest section of the forest to the the edge of town. <text:s/>No sense in making it a longer walk than necessary especially when you are trying to be sneaky. <text:s/>The plot itself was a completely generic area of moderate forest on starting on the border and stretching a half mile into the forest. <text:s/>The sole interesting feature was a camouflaged tunnel half way down one of the edges. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T190">Wild was ready to begin her foray into interior design.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P108" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 10</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T335">Wild and Rose stood just outside the hidden tunnel when Wild grinned, “Alright time to see some of what I can do.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T335">What do you mean?” asked Rose but Wild was walking over to a tree nearby tree. <text:s/>When she reached it Wild placed a hoof on its surface, and closed her eyes. <text:s/>She would need a lot of concentration for this to prevent any unfortunate accidents. <text:s/>Soon a ring of black tendrils erupted from the tree&apos;s bark around the hoof slowly expanding in a ring. <text:s/>Once it wrapped around the entire trunk the now two rings speed up running up and down the height of the tree. <text:s/>Strangely everywhere the tendrils passed looked exactly as it had before. <text:s/>Another ring would split off for every branch passed and every leaf would appear to erupt in black flame as the tendrils consumed it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T336">Rose was fascinated by the process as the tree was consumed and an exact replica left behind. <text:s/>Seeing the last of the visible tendrils disappear she expected Wild to come out of her trance soon. <text:s/>Rose was confused when that was not the case until new rings of tendrils appeared at the base of the two closest trees. <text:s/>The process repeat itself faster this time and again there was a period of seeming inactivity. <text:s/>Half a dozen trees this time started being consumed in pattern spreading away from the tunnel. <text:s/>Figuring that the pattern would continue she transformed back to her changeling form and watched from the air. <text:s/>Rose just hang in the air above the canopy watching as a black wave spread through the forest.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T337">By the Earth Mother, she is like a forest fire.” Rose whispered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T338">Oh no, she is much more than that.” <text:s/>a mare said next Rose startling the changeling. <text:s/>Casually </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T338">standing on thin air was a huge Earth pony mare. <text:s/>She was easily a match for Rose in terms of height. <text:s/>Her coat and Mane were both an earthy brown color, but her mane transitioned into vines as it near her body. <text:s/>The vines spread out across her in a thick webbing. <text:s/>Half of them were a vibrant green while the other half were black with wicked looking thorns. <text:s/>Both types covered her entire body running over and under at random and even ran the length of her tail binding it into a thick cord. <text:s/>The mare continued, “She is my latest experiment, and the most dangerous one by far. <text:s/>We are heading into some exciting times.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T338">You&apos;re the one who brought her?” Rose muttered, “Taking her from her world seems rather cruel.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T338">The mare chuckled, “I thought you knew me better than that, Formica. <text:s/>You know that I can be a cruel mistress.” <text:s/>The turned her attention back to Wild&apos;s work prompting Rose to do the same before adding, “Although in this case leaving her alone would have been more cruel. <text:s/>You already realize how terrifying what she&apos;s doing is, but this is controlled. <text:s/>Just imagine what would happen if instead of trees she did this to your changelings starting in the middle of your hive. <text:s/>It looks like nothing has happened down there because she is taking care to minimize the impact. <text:s/>If she wasn&apos;t doing that each of those trees would end up riddled with tumors and raw flesh spilling across the ground.” <text:s/>Looking Rose in the eyes the mystery mare concluded, “That is would be just the beginning of what she experienced.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T339">I go by Rose now, but just have you brought to Equestria, Earth Mother?” Rose demanded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T339">A catalyst.” the Earth Mother replied then turned back to the forest and commented, “Fascinating, leave it to a human to find a way to clear cut part of a forest without disturbing the local ecosystem.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T340">What are you talking about, the forest looks fine.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T340">It only looks fine, for that matter it only looks like a forest too. <text:s/>There isn&apos;t a single tree left down there.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T340">When Rose turned to ask the Earth Mother about her words Rose found only empty space. <text:s/>She huffed and watched Wild work. <text:s/>The line on affected trees ended up tracing out a rough circle about two thirds of a mile squared. <text:s/>A band about half the width of the circle was also affect leading off to the edge of the forest. <text:s/>All told Wild had claimed an enormous section of land for her estate. <text:s/>The sun was getting ready to set by the time she was done.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T341">That was a lot more exhausting than I thought.” <text:s/>Wild breathed eyes drooping and posture slumped. <text:s/>While she was practically immune to physical exhaustion, the stress of managing the spread of her infection taxed her mental endurance more than anything before. <text:s/>However, she was successful every tree in her plot of land was converted without affecting any of the other flora or fauna.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T341">Oh hey, Rose your a lady bug again.” Wild giggled, “Can I crash on your couch?” <text:s/>She managed to make it a few steps toward Rose, but then tripped over her own hooves plopping on her side. <text:s/>Squinting Wild tried to figure out what happen and why she was laying down. <text:s/>Her conclusion was to try again after sleeping. <text:s/>Rose levitated the heap of earth pony onto her back as she set off for </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T341">her hive. <text:s/>She was in agreement with Wild that some rest might help her make sense of all the recent chicanery.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T342">Rose felt something like a giant mass of squirming worms on her back for a second. <text:s/>When she checked to see what it was she found a tinier version of herself. <text:s/>Rose continued on and speculated, “Oh dear, we are in for a wild ride it seems.” <text:s/>Reaching one of the spare rooms Rose gently set Wild in a bed and left for her own bedroom. <text:s/>She did ask one of her nearby drones to notify her when Wild woke up. <text:s/>She did not pay attention when said drone referred to Wild as her daughter.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T342">When Wild woke up she felt better than she had in a long time, although she did not remember falling asleep in a bed. <text:s/>Looking around the room saw that it was rather spartan with only a bed, table, and lights. <text:s/>The walls and furniture were all made of some kind of hardened dirt cement type compound. <text:s/>The lights were some sort of bioluminescent bulbs on the wall. <text:s/>Figuring it was safe enough she took stock of herself.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T343">Concentrating on her sense Wild realized her awareness was massively expanded. <text:s/>She could vaguely sense the entire forest that she converted, and felt the suns rays on her leaves. <text:s/>They felt deliciously warm almost like eating pancakes hot off the stove. <text:s/>“Oh sweet, I&apos;m solar powered now!” she exclaimed before digging deeper. <text:s/>The wind was the next sensation she found, but it was the strange tapping feeling appearing in a multitude of locations. <text:s/>She could not figure out what it was and decided to pick one and see what it was. <text:s/>Closing her eyes, and growing a new set near the tapping she found a squirrel hopping along a branch. <text:s/>“Oh crap, I&apos;m going to be constantly feeling everything that moves.” <text:s/>she whimpered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T344">Rose walked into the room to find Wild with eyes unfocused, and frowning. <text:s/>“What has you so down, dear?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T344">I have made a horrible miscalculation.” <text:s/>Wild moaned after refocusing her eyes, “I can feel all of the animals, its like being poked incessantly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T345">So you really did decide to assimilate a square mile of forest.” Rose said massaging her brow with a hoof before scolding, “Child, you should have thought of that before you made yourself into a makeshift genius loci. <text:s/>You&apos;re just going to have to learn to deal with it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T345">I realize that now.” Wild whined planting her face on the floor, “on the bright side I have a decent map of the underground, and sunlight is delicious.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T345">What are you talking about now?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T345">I wanted to survey the land as well as claim it, so I made a vast web of roots from the trees. <text:s/>Also, consuming that many trees means I am, um...” Wild explained, “a photo-vore. <text:s/>That&apos;s probably not the right word.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P86"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T345">Huh, at least you got something out of that spectacle yesterday, but you have another situation to deal with. <text:s/>It seems your friends have noticed, and are coming to investigate,” Rose drawled before heading out of the room, “Come on, let&apos;s go.” <text:s/>Wild tried to protest, but Rose just grabbed Wild by the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T345">tail with magic and dragged her along. <text:s/>The tunnels they passed through were made of the same material as the bedroom complete with the glowing bulbs. <text:s/>It had a very organic feels as there were no right angles, just curves making the changeling hive labyrinthine. <text:s/>Along the way they encountered a group of changelings who addressed Wild as princess. <text:s/>Both Rose and Wild froze at that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178"><text:tab/>Wild just noticed that she was a changeling and giggled awkwardly. <text:s/>“oops,” she squeaked, and changed back to her normal form. <text:s/>The other changelings decide it was a good time to find anywhere else to be as the tension escalated in the tunnel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T346">One problem at a time.” Rose reasoned and continued out of the hive. <text:s/>She also changed into her usual disguise before leaving. <text:s/>She was able to keep a hold on Wild when she panicked at the fiery display but not without sliding backward a couple feet even though she had braced herself. <text:s/>The walk through the forest itself was quiet since most of the nearby animals were still confused by Wild&apos;s take over. <text:s/>Wild now traveling under her own power decided to hum in an effort to ignore the infernal tapping.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T347">Rose and Wild exited the forest together not far from a trio of ponies. <text:s/>Rose had a frown on her face and Wild had her ears folded back and was now humming “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T191">taps”</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T43">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T191">Rose, Twilight, and Fluttershy were all giving her blank looks. <text:s/>The last pony was a blond maned orange earth pony mare with a brown stetson. <text:s/>The hatted pony was glaring at Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:span text:style-name="T191"><text:tab/>“Really. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T192">You&apos;re just here for an explanation not an execution.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T191">” Rose </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T192">scolded and addressed other group, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T193">Fluttershy, Applejack, and Twilight I assume you</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T192"> are here because of last nights occurrences.” <text:s/>Receiving nods she pushed Wild up to them and said, “Well here&apos;s your explanation. <text:s/>Go on Wild dear.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:span text:style-name="T192"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T193">Well... you see...” Wild stalled and gradually lowered her volume until inaudible.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P122"><text:tab/>“Well, spit it out already, what did you do in the Everfree last night?!” Applejack snarled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“I consumed all of the trees in approximately one square mile of the forest.” Wild said staring at a spot on the ground </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T197">pointedly avoiding Applejack&apos;s eyes</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T193">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P122"><text:tab/>“YOU DID WHAT?!” Applejack yelled stomping up to Wild and tried to get into her face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“I consumed all of the trees in approximately one square mile of the forest.” Wild repeated still staring at the same spot. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T194">The other tree ponies did not like where this conversation was going, but could only watch. <text:s/>Applejack did a half turn and cocked her legs for a buck in an instant. <text:s/>Wild however was able to catch her intention fast enough to drop to the ground before Applejack could complete her buck. <text:s/>When Applejack overextended herself took to the opening and stood back up causing Applejack to flip over onto her back.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:span text:style-name="T194"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T196">Enough, both of you</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T194">!” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T195">Rose scolded, “I swear this town is full of children sometimes. <text:s/>You don&apos;t have to like each other, but you do have to remain civil.” <text:s/>Once Applejack returned to hooves Rose asked, “Now are you both calm?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:span text:style-name="T195"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T196">Yes,” muttered Applejack.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T196"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T197">No,” said Wild causing everyone to turn their attention to her. <text:s/>She was still staring at the same spot, but now the ponies noticed her unfocused eyes. <text:s/>Rose went to try getting Wild&apos;s attention, but Wild shifted over a foot just before Rose&apos;s hoof could reach her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:span text:style-name="T197"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T198">Wild, we are all calming down.” Rose soothed recognizing the symptoms, “Can you do that with us?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P123"><text:tab/>“No.” Wild answered.<text:tab/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P123"><text:tab/>“Oh come on,” Applejack interrupted, “quit being difficult.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P123"><text:tab/>“Oh, um, Applejack you shouldn&apos;t be too hard on her.” Fluttershy pointed out, “If its alright with you let&apos;s go back to Ponyville.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:span text:style-name="T198"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T199">She&apos;s just trying to be difficult.” Applejack argued, “All she needs is some sense knocked into her.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P124"><text:tab/>“Applejack, she&apos;s having a panic attack.” Rose explained. <text:s/>She also noted that Wild&apos;s had puffed up her coat. <text:s/>On anyone else it would have been an attempt to seem bigger, but Rose already knew Wild would not need to pretend. <text:s/>Given her abilities this was not something Rose wanted to see tested and implored, “Please, go back to Ponyville with Fluttershy.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P124"><text:tab/>“But--” Applejack started, but was interrupted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:span text:style-name="T199"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t want to see you making the situation any worse.” Rose snapped and this time Applejack begrudgingly listened. <text:s/>She made her way back to Ponyville with Fluttershy, and Rose breathed a sigh when she was out of sight. <text:s/>Rose </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T200">cooed to</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T199"> Wild, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T200">It&apos;s alright dear, you don&apos;t need to be afraid anymore. Can you calm down for me?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P125"><text:tab/>“I...” Wild hesitated before hissing, “I can&apos;t, it might be a trap.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P126"><text:tab/>“It&apos;s not a trap, we just want to help you.” <text:s/>Twilight pleaded now that she understood what was happening. <text:s/>She also tried to move in for a hug, but Rose stopped her with a hoof. <text:s/>Confused Twilight asked, “The books said to reassure ponies in a panic attack. <text:s/>What&apos;s wrong with giving her a hug?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T349">“A... hug?” said Wild perplexed. <text:s/>Her muzzle scrunched up as her mind went to work on the new information. She whispered, “An interrogator would never risk contacting the infected.” <text:s/>Her coat flattened back down as she realized, “That&apos;s right I already consumed them.” <text:s/>One more realization caused her eyes to widen, and she pulled Twilight into a hug. <text:s/>A few tears landed on Twilight&apos;s back as Wild apologized, “I&apos;m so sorry Twilight. <text:s/>Thank you for trying to give me a hug, but my coat was stiff enough at the time to poke you full of holes. <text:s/>Also the venom would have paralyzed you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T349">Twilight&apos;s eyes shrunk to pin pricks and she whimpered, “Oh, thats a pretty good reason... but how did you know Rose? <text:s/>Also, its nice to meet you, I&apos;m Twilight Sparkle.” <text:s/>Wild released the mare from the hug.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T349">Rose Bloom,” Rose responded, </text:span>“<text:span text:style-name="T349">Her coat puffed up. <text:s/>Animals do that to seem bigger, but I don&apos;t know of any animal larger than a square mile of forest. <text:s/>I figured this scamp here was up to </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T349">something sneakier.” <text:s/>Rose sighed, “That was a pretty fast emotional turn around you just had, how are you feeling?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T350">Along with having an absurd biology, my brain is just as alien.” Wild lectured, “My mind is a copy of me as a human, but my brain isn&apos;t an organ anymore. <text:s/>The brain in this body is actually defunct, and my entire body function as a distributed brain of sorts. <text:s/>Right now I literally have a brain that spans a chunk of the Everfree, but most of that brain power is spent processing the sensory input of said chunk.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T350">You&apos;re avoiding the topic.” <text:s/>Rose declared while Twilight tried to make sense of the new information. Rose gently continued, “I know you may not want to talk about it, but it really would help. <text:s/>Are you willing to tell us what happened in your past?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T350">I...” Wild stammered, “I don&apos;t know.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T350">I&apos;m willing to wait the entire day if you need, but this has to be your decision.” Rose bargained, “We care about you, Wild.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T351">After considering it, Wild this was ultimately unavoidable for her. <text:s/>She relented, “Alright, I doubt there will be a better time for this, but first trying to maintain two bodies is getting to be a headache.” <text:s/>She walked over to a tree and hung her bag on a convenient low branch. <text:s/>She sat down against the trunk and leaned back into the tree. <text:s/>To the surprise of the other ponies Wild closed her eyes, and bark grew across her coat to securing her to the tree. <text:s/>“Ok, I need more practice with multiple bodies, its harder than I thought,” She effused now that she only had to manage a single immobile form.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T352">How are you speaking,” Twilight inquired looking around for the source of Wild&apos;s voice.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T352">It&apos;s the leaves. <text:s/>I learned how to reproduced sounds for amusement, pretty helpful now.” Wild explained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T352">You&apos;re stalling again” Rose said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T352">Right,” Wild conceded, “first I would like to emphasize that I was among the weakest physically. <text:s/>I&apos;m not much of a fighter, even now after taking over these trees I would not stand a chance if I tried to fight in fair battle. <text:s/>So, I spent most of the time hiding as one of the other refugees in the city. <text:s/>I even ended being called Athena. <text:s/>Not accurate, but no one knew my real name. <text:s/>The worst part was that safety was only couple miles away, but we were quarantined and no one could be bothered to simply let the uninfected out. <text:s/>I know they could detect the virus, they just didn&apos;t care.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T352">Twilight and Rose were laying down at this point just listening. <text:s/>Wild continued, “The whole disaster ended up being some unholy cross between a zombie plague, and a miniature war. <text:s/>The refugees were neutral which just meant that we were simply used by the two factions involved. <text:s/>Blacklight, a secret paramilitary group, used us as test subjects. <text:s/>The infected just viewed us as food. Now, the infected at the beginning were almost entirely zombies. <text:s/>There were two exceptions the one who released the infection and me. <text:s/>We were the only two that could control it through some quirk of </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T352">fate. <text:s/>Unfortunately, my parents and me were all infected shortly after the initial outbreak.” <text:s/>Wild paused as she remembered the event. <text:s/>“That was the second worst time of my life. <text:s/>My entire body was ripped apart and reassembled and I remained conscious through the whole process. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t even get enough time to catch my breath before being attacked. <text:s/>My parents died and were twisted into deformed caricatures of a human that were barely recognizable and they were hostile to everything. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t look infected so they attacked, but I wasn&apos;t human so they couldn&apos;t infect me or kill me. <text:s/>I was cut and ripped to pieces before they left me for dead.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T353">Both ponies were crying at that point, allowing Wild to reflect on the memory. <text:s/>She realized that her parents were never properly laid to rest. <text:s/>None of her friends and family were for that matter. <text:s/>There was never an opportunity back then, but now she could give them a memorial. <text:s/>She could actually get some closure.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T353">Rose was the first to speak up, “I don&apos;t know what to say. <text:s/>You&apos;ve gone through more than anyone in Equestria has save for the Princesses.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T353">Don&apos;t worry, just listening is enough.” <text:s/>Wild reassured, “It actually is nice to finally talk about it. <text:s/>I couldn&apos;t before since it would have given away what I was.” <text:s/>A tension that had been with her was eased, but it was replaced by another when she thought about the next part of her story. “Are...” she began, but hesitated. <text:s/>“Are you still willing to hear the next part? <text:s/>It only gets worse at this point.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T354">Both ponies just nodded to that. <text:s/>Wild was still reluctant, as she collected her memories of that time. <text:s/>She had buried them, but now they would be revealed. <text:s/>She would also have to reveal another fact she did not want to admit, even to herself. <text:s/>She steeled her resolve, ready to take the plunge despite the risks. <text:s/>She confessed, “I&apos;m a murderer.” <text:s/>As expected she was met with confusion, but with the first step taken it was easier. <text:s/>“I&apos;ve killed and eaten people, over a hundred at this point. <text:s/>Many of them innocent, but some of them were irredeemably evil. <text:s/>Those ones I enjoyed. <text:s/>I hate that I enjoyed it, but I really did want those ones to suffer.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T354">Rose had a pensive expression, but Twilight looked like someone had just jammed a lemon in her mouth. <text:s/>Rose had only a single, “Why tell us this?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T354">I hate hiding, that was what let Blackwatch become the monsters they are.” <text:s/>Wild returned since she had been asking herself the same. <text:s/>“Regardless of the results, I just want to stop hiding it, stop worrying about what might happen if you found out. <text:s/>That and I&apos;m of the opinion that its better to air your own dirty laundry than to let someone else do it for you.” <text:s/>The expression confused the other two, but the context was clear enough. <text:s/>Rose seemed satisfied with the explanation, but Twilight was not.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T354">Surely there was a better way, you didn&apos;t need to kill them.” <text:s/>Twilight blurted out.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T354">There may have been a better way for the evil ones, but I&apos;m not perfect. <text:s/>Everyone has they&apos;re breaking point and they pushed my past mine.” <text:s/>Wild reasoned, “You can judge for yourself after hearing what they did, but I do not regret killing them. <text:s/>The innocent ones were a different matter completely, I still can&apos;t see a way they could have survived. <text:s/>The only mercy I could give them was a quick death.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T354">Seeing Twilight build up for an argument Rose butted in, “Twilight, let&apos;s hear the full story first. <text:s/>Not everywhere is as peaceful as Equestria, and sometimes killing really is the kindest thing you can do.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T354">Thank you.” Wild said, “This part of my life is where I picked up most of my neurosis. <text:s/>I learned the hard way that regeneration and a photographic memory can be double edged swords. <text:s/>At the time I was still new to my abilities, and they mostly worked on their own. <text:s/>Fire and automatic regeneration are a terrible combination. <text:s/>The first time I encountered it was from a Molotov cocktail, a glass bottle with alcohol and a burning rag in it. <text:s/>One the other refugees discovered my infection and hit with it. <text:s/>The regeneration made sure that my nerves worked as the fire continuously ate away at my flesh. <text:s/>It would have killed me, but I wasn&apos;t that lucky. <text:s/>Instead some nearby Blackwatch members heard the screaming, and put out the fire. <text:s/>They didn&apos;t let me die, I was too useful to them instead I was kept in a glass cage. <text:s/>I have no idea how long I was in there, there only thing to judge the passage of time with were the... feedings”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T354">Rose&apos;s face paled as she realized the implication and tried to deny, “No, please don&apos;t tell me they...” <text:s/>She couldn&apos;t finish the thought, and Twilight was left confused.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T354">What were they doing?” Twilight worried looking between the two ponies.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T354">I think Rose guessed it, but these people value efficiency above ethics. <text:s/>I wasn&apos;t the only infected they had captured, and despite how strange out metabolism may be, it still existed. <text:s/>We needed to be fed if they wanted us alive, and there happened to be a large source food nearby if you lack morals. <text:s/>They fed us the refugees, they just tossed them into the cages and then no more refugee. <text:s/>It was also a convenient way for them to dispose of bodies too.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T354">Now enlightened, Twilight responded by violently purging her stomach on the nearest tree. <text:s/>Glad for a reprieve from the current topic Wild commented, “Twilight, you seem to be making a habit out of this. <text:s/>Although I probably am the only pony who doesn&apos;t mind being vomited on.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T354">But I didn&apos;t hit you.” <text:s/>Twilight countered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T354">Deciding it would be a good idea to mark which trees were her, Wild grew tendrils on the trunks of each tree colored to match her coat. <text:s/>It looked like vines had suddenly engulfed the forest. <text:s/>Then she explained, “I literally am every tree with a green trunk. <text:s/>Something I did not consider the implication of properly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T354">Oh,” Twilight choked, “and I just... <text:s/>I&apos;m so sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T354">Seriously, don&apos;t worry about it.” <text:s/>Wild chuckled, “I cover hundreds of acres, you aren&apos;t even the only creature currently making a mess on me. <text:s/>One of those implication that I didn&apos;t consider.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T354">Oh, yuck, Wild.” both ponies complained in unison at the imagery. <text:s/>Rose continued, “We should get back on topic though. <text:s/>I get the impression there&apos;s still more to come.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T355">There is, Blackwatch was very interested in me since I was one of two known anomalies with the Blacklight virus. <text:s/>In order to aid their study of me, they required my cooperation be it voluntary or </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T355">forced. <text:s/>I assume there are magical methods of mental control.” Receiving a nod from Twilight, Wild continued, “Well, I don&apos;t know what they are like but the mundane ways to brainwash someone are brutal. <text:s/>Fire is one of the few things that produced a &apos;satisfactory response&apos; as the scientist put it, so that&apos;s what they use to control me for the most part. <text:s/>I was too stubborn for that to break me though, so they moved onto psychological tactics.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T355">The leaves on every one of Wild&apos;s trees shook briefly before she continued, “That was what finally broke my will completely. <text:s/>At least as far as they knew. <text:s/>Turns out that having a conscience can be a problem when dealing with monsters. <text:s/>I hated feeding time, but I had to eat. <text:s/>At first it wasn&apos;t too bad though, the food was brought in dead. <text:s/>I could rationalize that easily, they&apos;re dead they don&apos;t need a body anymore after all. <text:s/>It maybe cold, but that got me through most of the time. <text:s/>Then I tried to defy them, and that&apos;s the first time I got to experience a live feeding. <text:s/>They put some man into the cage with me and left.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T355">Wild hesitated before she could get the next part. <text:s/>When she was able to progress again the volume of her voice wavered from the emotions as she stammered, “At first I was confused about why they would put him here. <text:s/>My guess was that he was supposed to be a spectator when they brought the dead body later. <text:s/>Soon enough confusion gave way to boredom and we both sat in our own little corners until our keepers returned. <text:s/>Only they didn&apos;t, and I was the first to realize what was going on when the hunger pangs showed up. <text:s/>I don&apos;t experience hunger the same way as you, instead of sensation its just the knowledge that I am running low on energy. <text:s/>Then as I get lower my mind starts getting fuzzier, I think slower, my vision gets worse, and I start to lose focus on things. <text:s/>The last thing I saw was the terror on the man face as my body began falling apart. <text:s/>Then I woke up in his body slumped against the wall of the cage and looking at my own corpse. <text:s/>The best I can figure out is that whatever mental connection the virus produces failed and it reverted back to its default highly infectious state.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T355">This time it was Rose that had the most dramatic reaction. <text:s/>She had to get up before the Wild even finished and expelled her own stomach. <text:s/>What came out though was not what Wild expected. <text:s/>It was thick dark green fluid that glowed slightly. <text:s/>She made a note of the oddity and collected the fluid to investigate later. <text:s/>Sitting back down Rose rasped, “How are you still sane?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T355">There are two answers to that. <text:s/>The Blacklight virus is a very mixed blessing. <text:s/>It is great at copying and storing information, but its not perfect. <text:s/>My emotion are somewhat off, I have less empathy now, and weaker emotional responses. <text:s/>The virus is much more suited to analytical thinking making me more resilient to trauma.” Wild elaborated, “The more significant reason is that, I&apos;m not sane. <text:s/>Not completely at least. <text:s/>You already know my feelings about fire, and I have a compulsion to answer questions. <text:s/>Whatever else they may be Blackwatch is effective and that held true for there interrogations. <text:s/>They wanted reliable answers from me so they made me unable to ignore or knowingly lie when asked a question.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T355">Magic can&apos;t do that.” <text:s/>Twilight stated, “You can&apos;t just make someone tell the truth.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T355">I said knowingly lie. <text:s/>Its not objective truth, its what I regard as true.” <text:s/>Wild corrected, “Also, my world had no magic. <text:s/>Both myself, and everything the Blackwatch does are purely physical.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T355">Twilight cocked her head to the side, but otherwise stayed silent as she contemplated the possibility. <text:s/>However, Rose noticed something else and pointed out, “So that&apos;s what happened with Applejack. <text:s/>We have been forcing you to answer questions.” <text:s/>She went on to inquire, “You became more manipulative to counter it didn&apos;t you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T355">Yes, the original programming was for the complete truth, but I managed to weaken it down to just the technically correct truth. <text:s/>That leaves me with plenty of wiggle room, and I just think of it as a personality quirk.” Wild explained, “Unfortunately, Applejack triggered a relapse. <text:s/>While not verbose, I would have answered any question honestly and directly.” <text:s/>As an after thought Wild added, “Please, don&apos;t try to abuse that. <text:s/>Along with the obvious, it&apos;s also dangerous. <text:s/>You could easily be labeled as Blackwatch agents in that state with possibly... fatal consequences.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T356">How much danger was she in?” Rose demanded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T356">Relatively little, but still too much.” Wild confessed, “My response to her were escalating, and if she pushed enough...” Wild trailed off before quickly pointing out, “She would have a hard time actually hurting me, and probably would have ended up temporarily paralyzed at worst.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T356">Rose sighed, “I&apos;ll have to talk with her about picking her fights better.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T356">Also, there&apos;s one more part left.” Wild added.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T356">It gets worse!” Twilight exclaimed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T356">Yes, that wasn&apos;t the only live feeding. <text:s/>After that one though I didn&apos;t let myself starve again. <text:s/>Instead I would try talking to them and killing them quickly while distracted. <text:s/>It was as much as I could <text:s/>do for them.” <text:s/>Wild said before explaining, “Assuming that the memories are intact, I end up with a copy when I consume a creature. <text:s/>I have the memories from every single person I&apos;ve killed, its more trouble than its worth. <text:s/>For most its just having to experience their death that&apos;s the worst. <text:s/>Seeing from their perspective as I watch myself kill them, knowing every thought going through their head at the time. <text:s/>The Blackwatch guys were the worst though. <text:s/>Their monstrous acts weren&apos;t limited to me and I got see all of their crimes, all of their victims. <text:s/>I got to know with certainty that the were enjoying every second of it. <text:s/>I also got to see that they were not happy with me trying to be nice to my victims.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T356">Building up steam behind her rant Wild seethed, “I don&apos;t know how, but they found my best friend, Jenell Patterson. <text:s/>She was my last friend too. <text:s/>Before the outbreak I was just an average teenage girl with plenty of friends doing teenage girl stuff. <text:s/>Unfortunately, teenage girls don&apos;t have a good survival rate in zombie infested ruins. <text:s/>We all died in the end. <text:s/>Instead of staying dead though I got to be the one to kill the last of my friends. <text:s/>Unlike the others they told her what was happening before dumping her in my cage. <text:s/>For instant she was happy to see someone familiar before remember what I am and switched to terror. <text:s/>Then I saw the moment her brain kicked in and she realized why she was really there. <text:s/>That she was being used to break me. <text:s/>I just sat there like a lump repeat the word &apos;no&apos; when she offered to kill herself. <text:s/>She figured that she wasn&apos;t getting out of there alive regardless, so why not made it easier for me. <text:s/>I also later learned that she thought that having her entire life permanently etched into my memory was a better remembrance than most people got. <text:s/>In the end </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T356">though a glass jar doesn&apos;t give many options to kill oneself and I had to do it. <text:s/>We hugged one last time, and right before the end she said &apos;I&apos;m sorry&apos;.” Wild wailed, “She apologized to me even though I wasn&apos;t the one that was going to die.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T357">Everfree weather was always strange, but this was the only time it rained without a single cloud in the sky.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P109" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 11</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T357">Most of the morning had passed by the time that the ponies recovered. <text:s/>There was still one question that Rose and Twilight had not gotten the answer to. <text:s/>“How did you escape?” Rose asked, “I can&apos;t imagine they just let you go after all of that.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T358">They didn&apos;t. <text:s/>I don&apos;t really know if it was negligence or complacency, but they let the cage deteriorate. <text:s/>In order to actually contain me they needed a hermetically sealed container, but I still need oxygen in order to breathe so there was self contained unit that recycled the air in the chamber. <text:s/>The unit was in a separate location though with a duct connecting the two.” <text:s/>Wild explained, “In an act of petty defiance I would probe the cage daily for weakness. <text:s/>I guess they never noticed since they never punished me for it. <text:s/>One day I found the weakness I needed, the seal between the cage and the air duct was cracked. <text:s/>I couldn&apos;t fit my whole body through that, but I could send a dust sized piece of myself through. <text:s/>That was all it took, slowly I used that little piece to collect biomass outside while keeping it hidden. <text:s/>I don&apos;t regret what I did after that,” she sighed, “but I cannot deny that it was a brutal and merciless act.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T359">Wild&apos;s friends were paying rapt attention at this point, though their ears folded back at the last statement. <text:s/>“I figured &apos;hey I&apos;m basically a disease why not act like it&apos;. <text:s/>I infect the first person I could and set up a little beachhead for myself. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t want to be noticed though so I stayed asymptomatic and just worked on being infectious. <text:s/>A sneeze here, or unwashed hands was enough to spread me without any of them noticing. <text:s/>They actually did have detectors in case of containment breach, they never considered that I might take the slow methodical route though. <text:s/>The amount of infection in each person was too small for them to detect so I could basically move freely.” <text:s/>Wild laughed, “The preparation were completed without incident and that was the first time I smiled since the outbreak. <text:s/>I think one of the guards noticed, but by then I was letting the virus run wild in all of them. <text:s/>I just sat in my cage listening to the sirens going off and watching the panic in the nearby guards. <text:s/>There was nothing they could do at that point, the entire facility had been infected at the same time as far as they could tell for the few minutes they had to live. <text:s/>From there all I had to do was pick a body and walk out.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T359">That&apos;s...” Twilight started, but couldn&apos;t finish. <text:s/>She sat there wide eyed, not know what to think.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T359">Monstrous.” Wild finished for her, “I know. <text:s/>I don&apos;t have a justification for it, but I didn&apos;t get out of without consequence either. <text:s/>That was what earned me the code name Athena, and shot me to the top of their list of targets, on par with the one who released the virus in the first place. <text:s/>Also I consumed all of those people, I got all of their memories. <text:s/>They were all Blackwatch members, and now I have to </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T359">live with detailed knowledge of every crime they committed. <text:s/>I basically inherited all of their sins. <text:s/>In the end they broke me, but they didn&apos;t expect that I would remake myself into a monster to break them in return. <text:s/>The only redeeming quality being that I only target bigger monsters.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T359">I don&apos;t know what to think.” Twilight glumly said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T359">All I can tell you is that there are no black and whites, everything is a shade of gray.” Wild replied, “Blackwatch was originally created to protect the people. <text:s/>The lost their way, but even now they still have the same goal. <text:s/>It&apos;s just been twisted beyond recognition.” <text:s/>She took the time to shift back into her pony body since the worst of the conversation was over.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T359">As far as I am concerned, having to live with all of the memories is a better penance than anything I could do.” <text:s/>Rose asserted. <text:s/>She frowned in thought before asking, “Would you do any of that in Equestria?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T359">Wild frowned in return, met Rose&apos;s eyes and stated, “Yes, its not just self-deprecation when I say I&apos;m a monster. <text:s/>I would kill them all over again if I were back in that situation, and I would do the same for any Equestrian monsters as well. <text:s/>Though even that bomb the other day is nowhere near what it would take for me to respond that way. <text:s/>I would rather just let the guards handle it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T359">Rose shook her head and snorted, “Not ideal, but then I suppose nothing is perfect. <text:s/>At least you acknowledge your faults. <text:s/>You may be a monster, but you are also a good pony.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T359">How can you be both?” Twilight puzzled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T359">One bad trait doesn&apos;t make all the others bad.” <text:s/>Rose explained, “Although, there may be a correlation between there.” <text:s/>Twilight did not look convinced, but her stomach had its own argument. <text:s/>It growled loud enough for everyone to hear as she blushed. <text:s/>“It is about lunch time.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T359">The three ponies headed back to Ponyville. <text:s/>Rose split off to go find Applejack, Twilight returned to her library, and Wild decided to continue camping in front of the fountain again. <text:s/>This time she was paying attention for any suspicious ponies which was easy since the rest of the town was giving her a wide berth. <text:s/>While waiting to see if someone would talk with her Wild decided to play around with her new forest. <text:s/>She want to add sonar to the trees. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T44">Huh, I think I might be paranoid, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T201">Wild wondered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T44">but damn it I like seeing everything around me. <text:s/>And they actually are out to get me.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:span text:style-name="T201"><text:tab/>Her waiting payed off in a sense, a pony actually approached Wild. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T202">When she opened her eyes she found Lyra approaching her with a blank expression. <text:s/>Stopping in front of Wild, Lyra just stared for a second before asking, “Do you have any concept of subtlety?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P127"><text:tab/>“I was pretty good at it before I got here. <text:s/>Now that I think about it that probably had more to do with the number of people, and everyone worrying about not dying.” <text:s/>Wild answered not sure where this was going. “Maybe not.” Wild concluded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P127"><text:tab/>“You stick out like a sore hoof.” Lyra groaned planting her face in her hooves. <text:s/>“You really did take over a chunk of the Everfree forest, didn&apos;t you?” She accused.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P127"><text:tab/>“Yes, nobody was using it, so it seemed like a good idea at the time...” Wild confessed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P127"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“Why?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:span text:style-name="T202"><text:tab/>“Oh, I want to build a house there.” Wild professed, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T203">I think its lovely location now that I can keep all of the larger creatures away.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P128"><text:tab/>“You needed a whole square mile for a house?” <text:s/>Lyra deadpanned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P128"><text:tab/>“Yep,” <text:s/>Wild chirped, “most of it is a buffer to keep out unwanted visitors, but I&apos;ll make a pond, and maybe some other landscaping.” <text:s/>Her ears lowered when she said, “I also want to make a memorial.” <text:s/>That got a few gasps from the ponies that had start gathering to watch the conversation. <text:s/>Its not everyday you get to watch the two craziest ponies in town argue. <text:s/>They did not expect that last comment. <text:s/>“I&apos;ve already lost everything else, I only have memories left. <text:s/>So I&apos;m going to make a memorial for them when I can find the materials.” <text:s/>Wild declared.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:span text:style-name="T203"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T204">Hearing that the spectating ponies did not know what to say. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T203">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T204">How did you lose them?” a mare asked from behind the crowd. <text:s/>The mare made her way to the front and revealed herself as Applejack.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“A plague struck the city I lived in.” Wild responded surprised that Applejack wanted know, “I lost some to plague itself, but it was a slow attrition as everything around us fell apart. <text:s/>Lack of food, or clean water and exposure to the winter ended up being too much. <text:s/>I am the only one that managed to escape.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“You must be pretty special, how did you escape?” <text:s/>Applejack inquired now joined in the group with Lyra and Wild.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“I didn&apos;t think I was that special, but someone else did. <text:s/>I was summoned here by someone named Gaia.” <text:s/>Wild said, “I&apos;m not really sure why. <text:s/>She basically just said &apos;I brought you here, have fun&apos; and left me in the Everfree forest.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“Gaia?” both Applejack and Lyra questioned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“She also said some called her Mother Earth.” Wild supplied.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“That explains some things.” Lyra mumbled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>Applejack decided to switch topics and challenged, “What did you mean when you said you took over part of the Everfree forest? <text:s/>You some kind of forest spirit?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“No” Wild stated at the same time as Lyra stated, “Yes”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“Well which is it?” Applejack demanded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“She is literally part of the forest now. <text:s/>She controls the plants and land, and can project herself through them from what I understand. <text:s/>Even if she hasn&apos;t realized it yet, she is the spirit of the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Well, a relatively small part of it at least.” answered Lyra before Wild could respond.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“Huh, I never thought about it like that.” Wild mused with a hoof on her chin, “Yeah, I guess I am a forest spirit now. <text:s/>Neat.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“So, you&apos;re not some kinda zombie?” Applejack asked with narrowed eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>Wild went to answer, but Lyra put her hoof in Wild&apos;s mouth. <text:s/>“She means undead, with necromancy and all that implies.” Lyra addressed to Wild before reclaiming her hoof.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“Oh, no I&apos;m not undead or anything. <text:s/>Just a 19 year old girl thats been through too much including dieing a couple times. <text:s/>My ability to heal myself still works if I&apos;m technically dead.” <text:s/>Wild answered while Lyra face hoofed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“That sounds to me like you used necromancy.” Applejack accused before pulling out a strange object. <text:s/>It was a metal disc about the size of a hoof with an ankh engraved into it. <text:s/>She tossed it to Wild who caught it on reflex to the surprise of Applejack.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“Nope, just normal cell division accelerated a little.” Wild countered as she inspected the new object. <text:s/>“What&apos;s this thing? <text:s/>Some kind of coin or something?” <text:s/>Wild asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“It&apos;s a ward of life, if you had been undead it would have disrupted the magic animating you.” <text:s/>Lyra explained and turned to Applejack. <text:s/>“I assume you believe us now.” she insisted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:span text:style-name="T204"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T205">Alright,” Applejack relented and her ears drooped. <text:s/>“I was wrong about you Wild Way. <text:s/>I&apos;m sorry for how I&apos;ve been treating you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P130"><text:tab/>“I forgive you.” Wild replied, “and here is your thingy back.” She hoofed the disc back to Applejack who put it away.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P130"><text:tab/>The crowd had started to wander off when a wagon entered the square drawing their attention. <text:s/>When it stopped in an empty area a stage popped out and a blue unicorn mare with a light blue mane stepped out. <text:s/>She was wearing a cape, and wizard hat with stars on it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:span text:style-name="T205"><text:tab/>“A magic show?” marveled Wild, “What&apos;s a magic like with real magic?” <text:s/>The trio went to join the rest of the crowd watching the show. <text:s/>Applejack wander off when she saw one of her friends, but Lyra stayed next to Wild. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T206">The stage mare introduced herself as The Great and Powerful Trixie, and proceeded to perform a variety of basic tricks, after bragging about vanquishing an Ursa Major.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:span text:style-name="T206"><text:tab/>“Alright, this is less interesting than I imagined.” Wild pouted, Lyra just shrugged. <text:s/>Then Trixie challenged the town. <text:s/>First Applejack went up there and did a series of lasso tricks. <text:s/>Trixie countered by using the lasso to hog tie Applejack. <text:s/>Next up was a blue pegasus with rainbow mane, she did some aerial tricks and made a rainbow upon landing. <text:s/>Trixie used lightning clouds to shock the mare off the stage. <text:s/>The final challenge was a white unicorn with curly purple mane. <text:s/>She created a costume out of pieces from the stage, but Trixie just turned her mane green. <text:s/>That was enough for the white unicorn as she ran off crying. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T207">Well, that was a let down. <text:s/>At least the ponies from ponyville were pretty talented.” <text:s/>Wild sighed then added, “I would like to see her take on an Ursa Major though.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P131"><text:tab/>“A traveling performer and the only good thing about her show were the local ponies.” Lyra agrees and shakes her head. <text:s/>“She would get torn apart by the Ursa.” Lyra retorts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:span text:style-name="T207"><text:tab/>“Not if she runs fast enough.” <text:s/>Lyra goes her own way and Wild returns to trying to set up forest wide echolocation. <text:s/>By the evening she managed to get the network of sensors working for her and integrated to created one continuous view of her entire forest. <text:s/>Already she had found some interesting </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T207">things since she was better able to judge size. <text:s/>There were about half a dozen changelings hanging out in the branches, presumably </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T208">lookouts for the hive. <text:s/>There were also a pair of small ponies running through the forest, but they were too far away to get a clear image of. <text:s/>The fact that the ground started shaking slightly after they passed was suspicious. <text:s/>Increasing the height of one of her trees Wild was able to see of the rest of the Everfree forest and spotted an Ursa Minor. <text:s/>“Seriously, at least its only a minor one. <text:s/>Um, what to do.” Wild complained before deciding that Twilight was the closest person she knew that might be able to help. <text:s/>She did not want to kill it since it was only a child.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>Wild had her roots increase their density in an empty patch of her forest, and five groups of trees to twist together into large columns. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>While this was happening she had her pony body run to Twilight&apos;s library. <text:s/>“Twilight, we got a problem.” Wild shouted and banged on the door. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>Her roots had finished growing and created a solid mass in the general shape of a pony without legs or abdomen. <text:s/>The head raised above the forest floor. <text:s/>The outside of the mass had formed an even tighter mesh to point of essentially being armored. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Twilight” Wild continued to shout while dancing in place anxious to get the mare&apos;s attention. <text:s/>The Ursa was just a few hundred feet from her forest which meant that it was less than a mile away. <text:s/>Twilight opened the door and asked, “What is it?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>Back in her forest the torso of her construct was being lifted by the five columns that had connected to it. <text:s/>One for each leg and the last for a tail. <text:s/>The columns were being filled out for extra muscle mainly in the hind legs. <text:s/>The tail was changing into a collection of vines and had separated from the ground already.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“There&apos;s an Ursa Minor heading to the town and its only half a mile away. <text:s/>I&apos;m going to stop it from entering but I was hoping you had a good way of getting it to leave.” Wild blurted out. <text:s/>As an afterthought she added, “Oh, and two young ponies were running through the Everfree forest right before it showed up. <text:s/>I&apos;m going to head over there now.” <text:s/>Wild began walking toward the forest where she figured the giant would appear.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>Wild&apos;s giant was almost complete and had the general shape of a pony albeit an unnatrually thin one. <text:s/>In order to make it more friendly looking she added green moss to fill in the silhouette. <text:s/>Each leg lifted one by one to test it and detach it from the ground. <text:s/>The construct bent down and jumped over the <text:s/>forest between it and the plain outside of town.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>Wild had stopped just past the edge of town and watched her timber pony come in for a landing. <text:s/>The colts had already run past so the landing area was clear and the Ursa Minor was only a few seconds from appearing out of the tree line.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>Twilight, the timber pony and the ursa minor all showed up at the same time. <text:s/>The ursa minor was giant bear with a coat that appeared like the night sky. <text:s/>It was the same height as the surrounding trees and Wild&apos;s timber pony though it out massed the collection of dirt and trees. <text:s/>Twilight had stopped <text:s/>right next to Wild and just stared at the giant creatures in front of her. <text:s/>The bear was not as hesitant and <text:soft-page-break/>charge the giant pony. <text:s/>The giant pony shifted to face the bear and braced for the impact by digging into the ground. <text:s/>A loud clap sounded as the pair collided and while the pony held out against the charge parts of the outer layers were knocked off.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“The pony ones mine, if you have a plan for the bear now would be the time.” Wild explained without moving her body. <text:s/>Trying to maintain two was still beyond her but since the giant did not have eyes or mouth she could use the ones on her main body. <text:s/>Fortunately the bear was not able to get past Wild and just tried to bash apart the cobbled together body. <text:s/>Some cracks appeared and dirt would spill out but they would heal just a quickly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>Twilight set to work using the wind and some nearby cattails to play a lullaby. <text:s/>She also grabbed a water tower and filled it with milk. <text:s/>The ursa minor was more amicable and accepted the makeshift bottle. <text:s/>A little bit of rocking while levitating and the bear cub was asleep again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“I can take him back if you put him on the pony&apos;s back.” Wild offered and Twilight gently placed the ursa minor on the giant pony. <text:s/>Both giants then headed off into the forest following the trail the bear had left earlier. <text:s/>“Well, this has been an interesting day, but I think I am ready for it to end.” Wild stated.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Agreed.” Twilight mumbled and gets a look of curiosity. <text:s/>“How are you navigating the giant pony? <text:s/>It didn&apos;t have eyes and you can&apos;t see it from here.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Sonar. <text:s/>I&apos;ve had a lot of time to kill so I spent it tinkering with abilities. <text:s/>Acoustics tended to be a common area for me to tinker in.” Wild answered. <text:s/>“I could reproduce practically any kind of sound, but I haven&apos;t figured out how to make a sonic cannon yet.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“You&apos;re trying to make a weapon?” Twilight challenged with a scowl.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Not really, thats just a name. <text:s/>A sonic cannon produces sound in a beam instead of an expanding sphere. <text:s/>One thing that I learned from getting all that knowledge from Blackwatch is that anything can be turned into a weapon with enough creativity. <text:s/>I also believe that any weapon can be turned, as it were, back into a plowshare.” Wild elaborated, “For a sonic cannon it all depends on the volume. <text:s/>Loud enough and you have a weapon, but keeping it to a normal volume you have a neat way to transit sound much further than you otherwise could.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>The ursa made it back to its mother and the giant pony went to return to the ground it was formed from. <text:s/>Twilight looked pensive when she commented, “You are one hard to understand mare.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Maybe, but I think the real problem is I don&apos;t fit into existing categories.” Wild giggled at Twilight&apos;s consternation. <text:s/>“Alright, the ursa&apos;s back home, and now all thats left is clean up.” Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>At this point Lucent had made his way to the two mares after calming the crowd that had shown up to the earlier spectacle. <text:s/>“Hello, Miss Way. <text:s/>I take it this was another attempt on your life?” he questioned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“No, actually this one was just a couple of local colts. <text:s/>I noticed them running through the Everfree chased by the ursa. <text:s/>I get the feeling they were doing something ill advised, but not <text:soft-page-break/>malicious.” Wild recounted causing Lucent to rub his forehead.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“This town is going to be the death of me.” Lucent grumbled. <text:s/>“And that wooden golem? <text:s/>I take that was yours.” <text:s/>he inquired standing in front of Wild. <text:s/>Her ears folded back when she realized that Lucent probably did not know of her recent activities.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Well, you already know what I can do, and that wasn&apos;t a golem that was still me. <text:s/>I got the material for it from the Everfree forest.” <text:s/>Wild responded but did not want to meet his eyes. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t know if you heard, but I am now literally part of the forest. <text:s/>Specifically the part with all the vine covered trees. <text:s/>That giant was only a minute fraction of my total mass that I cobbled together for this.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“And how much is your total mass?” Lucent deadpanned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Don&apos;t you know not to ask a lady her weight.” <text:s/>Wild scolded, but Lucent did not react. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t know how much I weigh. <text:s/>I&apos;ve never measured the weight of a forest.” <text:s/>Wild relented. <text:s/>Lucent had a few more logistics questions, but once that was done he and the other ponies had wandered off. <text:s/>Wild decided that she was over due for a nap. <text:s/>A nice 36-hour nap.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P217" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 12</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:span text:style-name="T208"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T209">During her nap Wild also set to work on a couple projects. <text:s/>Underground she had found a wealth of gem deposits and decided to make the foundation of her home using them. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T210">Pockets of other minerals and access to the aquifer underneath the forest allowed her to make a strong concrete. <text:s/>She had gotten a lot of knowledge including material science information from Blackwatch and now she could try it out with some interesting materials.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:span text:style-name="T210"><text:tab/>She dug several tendrils straight down near the center of her forest to provide access to the bedrock. <text:s/>A cylinder of changeling chitin was grown about 20 feet across stretching the entire height and filled with dirt. <text:s/>The next step was to create veins through the structure to provide extra strength and the ability to repair any damage. <text:s/>Finally the dirt would be removed and concrete mixture added simultaneously starting at the bottom. <text:s/>All she had to do was run water through the vein to keep it coll and wait. <text:s/>After that and she would have a spider web reinforced sapphire concrete pillar as a solid support.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:span text:style-name="T210"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T211">She constructed six arches the same way that met the column just above the surface of the ground. <text:s/>Letting them sit and harden she created a sort of underground test chamber to find a way to create gems biologically. <text:s/>She did not have the slightest clue how to go about it so she just threw everything at it. <text:s/>Cells were created to try various tactics and combined based on result in a recreation of evolution. <text:s/>It may not be fast be she would find out how to lonsdaleite. <text:s/>If she was going to create a memorial then it was going to last and a mineral harder than diamond sounded perfect for that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:span text:style-name="T211"><text:tab/>Morning came by and Wild was fully refreshed even with her projects. <text:s/>She entered the town and remember that she had nothing to do today. <text:s/>Walking down the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T212">street she was accosted by a pair of fillies. <text:s/>One was pink with a tiara the other was gray and the both had the stereotypical snobby air about them. <text:s/>“I thought you were, like, gone. <text:s/>We don&apos;t want you here because you&apos;re a monster, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T238">and a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T238">blankflank</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T212">.” <text:s/>the pink one sneered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P133"><text:tab/>Quirking one eyebrow at the ridiculous pair, Wild assured, “What an adorable pair of brats. <text:s/>I can assure you that I am going to be here a long time, and I am a far bigger monster than you think. <text:s/>However, I eat sunlight so Ponyville&apos;s not in danger.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:span text:style-name="T212"><text:tab/>“We&apos;re not brats.” the brat raged. <text:s/>“I&apos;m going to tell my dad, and like, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T213">he will get rid of you.” she threatened and trotted off with her nose in the air. <text:s/>Her friend followed shortly behind, and Wild chuckled at their antics. <text:s/>At the same time a group of ponies was approaching her</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:span text:style-name="T213"><text:tab/>“Wild there you are. <text:s/>Princess Celestia wants you to help us remove a dragon.” Twilight </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T214">announced. <text:s/>“We need to hurry before he covers all of Equestria in smoke.” <text:s/>Applejack, Fluttershy, and Pinkie Pie were behind her with two other mares. <text:s/>A white unicorn with a curly purple mane and blue pegasus with a rainbow mane were also part of the group.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P134"><text:tab/>“Does she want me to slay a dragon?” <text:s/>Wild wondered with a sight tilt to her head.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P134"><text:tab/>“NO. No, that is not how we handle things, Wild.” Twilight scolded, “She just wants us to persuade the dragon to move somewhere else.” <text:s/>The other five had similar remarks to make.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P134"><text:tab/>“She should know the kind of person I am. <text:s/>I don&apos;t know what she expects me to do against a giant dragon...” Wild said before making a realization. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t suppose this is a non-fire breathing dragon.” Wild fretted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:span text:style-name="T214"><text:tab/>“Yes, its a fire-breathing one. <text:s/>That&apos;s why there&apos;s a smoke filling the sky.” <text:s/>Twilight </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T215">grumbled. <text:s/>Wild looked up to see that there was a indeed a cloud of smoke extending from nearby mountain.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“Oh.” Wild squeaked, “Are you sure you need me?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“What, a big mare like you is afraid a dragon. <text:s/>Don&apos;t worry you have THE Rainbow Dash with you.” <text:s/>the blue pegasus bragged.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:span text:style-name="T215"><text:tab/>“Alright, I come along, but I not going to look.” Wild said unconvinced. <text:s/>The group was confused about what she meant until she pulled out a silk cloth and tied it around her head. <text:s/>Now complete the group went to the mountain, and Wild trekked with them as if she were unimpaired. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T216">They tried to climb up the mountain, but Applejack had to take the long way since Fluttershy was too scared. <text:s/>They ended up waiting on wider part of the trail.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“Hello dear, I don&apos;t believe we&apos;ve met before. <text:s/>I am Rarity the owner of Carousel Boutique.” the white unicorn stated. <text:s/>“If you don&apos;t mind me asking what material is your blindfold made of?” Rarity inquired.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m Wild Way, current assassination target of Ponyville. <text:s/>Spider Silk, I actually make it myself and tend to use it whenever I need fabrics.” Wild answered and pulled out another swath of it to give to Rarity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“You don&apos;t say. <text:s/>I may have to buy some from you, if you are selling.” <text:s/>Rarity said while distracted by inspecting the fabric.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T215"><text:tab/>Rainbow Dash had heard the introduction too. <text:s/>“Wait, now I remember you. <text:s/>You&apos;re that mare that keeps hanging around the town square and blew up.” <text:s/>she proclaimed </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T216">pointing a hoof. <text:s/>“That was so awesome, and gross. <text:s/>How can you survive so much damage?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P136"><text:tab/>“Strangely enough through non-magic powers. <text:s/>I only need a small amount of myself to remain intact and I can regenerate from it. <text:s/>That explosion actually did next to nothing to me once I collected all of the pieces.” <text:s/>Wild explained.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P136"><text:tab/>“No way that wasn&apos;t magic. <text:s/>You&apos;re like some kind of superhero.” Rainbow <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P136"><text:tab/>“Be careful what you ask Rainbow, she will answer you no matter how unpleasant the answer.” <text:s/>Twilight warned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:span text:style-name="T216"><text:tab/>“I bet you have some kind of awesome past.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T217">Rainbow said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m not really up to dig that up again, but Twilight knows. <text:s/>Everyone in it was a monster or turned into one including me, and I don&apos;t mean monster in form.” Wild sighed. <text:s/>Conversation died down until Applejack arrived with Fluttershy in tow. <text:s/>The continued on until they came to a gap in the path. <text:s/>Most of the ponies were able to simply jump over. <text:s/>When Wild jump she landed with a distinct thump surprising the others.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“You got some meat on you, what have you been eating?” Applejack exclaimed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“Lately, sunlight. <text:s/>I&apos;m a photovore.” <text:s/>Wild proclaimed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“Autotroph. you&apos;re an autotroph.” Twilight corrected.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P92"><text:span text:style-name="T217"><text:tab/>“I knew there was a better word. <text:s/>I am an autotroph now that I can grow leaves.” <text:s/>Wild repeated and raised a foreleg with leaves sprouting from it. <text:s/>After a few seconds she shook them off and seeing all the perplexed faces asked, “What?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>Shaking their heads the ponies just continued on. <text:s/>When they reached an avalanche zone they made it half way through before Fluttershy screamed in fear and triggered an avalanche. <text:s/>Large rocks fell all around them as they tried to make it back to safety. <text:s/>One of the rocks was poised to hit Twilight, but Applejack was able to push her away. <text:s/>When Wild saw that Applejack was now going to be hit she repeated Applejack&apos;s actions pushing Applejack out of the way. <text:s/>The rock landed on Wild and was followed up by the bulk of the falling material and buried her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“She saved me.” Applejack marveled and began digging.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“That&apos;s just the kind of person she is. <text:s/>She would give her life to save others, but can mercilessly kill monsters. <text:s/>I can&apos;t figure out what to think about her.” <text:s/>Twilight admitting sharing the issue that had been bothering her with her friends.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“What do you mean darling?” Rarity inquired.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“She told me about what happened to her. <text:s/>She went on a rampage of sorts and killed dozens of terrible people. <text:s/>She even enjoyed it, but then she does something like this. <text:s/>I just can&apos;t figure out how someone can be a good monster like that.” <text:s/>Twilight ranted starting to pant a bit.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“So she&apos;s the monster that other monsters are afraid of. <text:s/>As long as she isn&apos;t going after anyone in Ponyville I don&apos;t see the problem.” <text:s/>Rainbow Dash stated and shrugged. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>The rocks in the debris pile started to shift and a black tendril came out. <text:s/>As the ponies watched it slithered out and coiled up on the ground. <text:s/>When all of it had gathered together smaller tendrils erupted from it and began taking the shape of a pony. <text:s/>Shortly afterward Wild was standing in front of the group once again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P92"><text:span text:style-name="T217"><text:tab/>“Ya know, I&apos;m just going to stop trying to make sense of the things you do.” Applejack decided the others silently agreed except Pinkie Pie. <text:s/>She never really would about others making sense in the first place. <text:s/>Continuing on the group made it to the peak without further problem. <text:s/>Only Wild noticed that there was a pony already up there. <text:s/>His stealth was ineffective against a blind mare, but she decided to wait and see what he would do. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T45">Hmm, only Celestia knew we would be here so is this her spy?, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T217">Wild <text:s/>pondered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P92"><text:span text:style-name="T217"><text:tab/>The plan ended up being each pony going in one by one. <text:s/>First Twilight, then Rarity went in and came back unsuccessful. <text:s/>Pinkie was next and went in wearing a... something. <text:s/>At that point Rainbow Dash was done with waiting and flew into the cave. <text:s/>Fortunately, Wild was able to reel her back in with her spider webs. <text:s/>“Woah there, you trying to get yourself killed.” <text:s/>Wild said, “You need more </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">than</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T217"> enthusiasm to take on a dragon, at least let me go find out what the problem is.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>Rainbow grumbled at that and waited impatiently. <text:s/>Wild went into the cave hoping that she could overcome her fear of fire if it came to a fight. <text:s/>“Alright, You already know what we are here for, but I want to know why here? What&apos;s so important about this cave?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P92"><text:span text:style-name="T217"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218">The dragon stared down at the strange mare either insane or brave enough to approach a dragon blind folded. <text:s/>“I doubt you would understand, but there is a new creature that has claimed the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">surrounding</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218"> area. <text:s/>I intend to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">prove it wrong</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218">.” the dragon said and laid down again. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T46">Whelp, I guess I&apos;m slaying a dragon, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218">Wild thought, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T46">How am I going to explain this?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P92"><text:span text:style-name="T46"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">You mean the town? <text:s/>What creature is this?” Wild asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P138"><text:tab/>“Ha, seems you are beneath its notice. <text:s/>Not surprising the creature is strong enough to stop one of those star bears.” the dragon laughed before laying his head down again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P92"><text:span text:style-name="T218"><text:tab/>“Well, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">he came to fight a creature that claimed Ponyville and can stop an Ursa</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218">.” <text:s/>Wild said to the ponies. <text:s/>Twilight was the first to understand the implication.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“You. He&apos;s here to fight you.” <text:s/>Twilight said dragging her hooves down her face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93"><text:span text:style-name="T218"><text:tab/>“Yep, t</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">his is a territory conflict between huge predators</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">There&apos;s going to be a fight and one of us is not coming out alive</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218">.” Wild said and braced for the backlash. <text:s/>Neither Twilight nor Fluttershy like the idea of fighting, Pinkie&apos;s hair deflated, and Applejack was worried about Wild getting injured. <text:s/>Rarity just called it &apos;uncouth&apos;, but Rainbow Dash was ready to go.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93"><text:span text:style-name="T218"><text:tab/>“You can&apos;t, fightings not the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">right</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">way</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218">. <text:s/>He just needs to be taught how to be nice to your fellow being.” <text:s/>Fluttershy said. <text:s/>Wild had started shifting herself to a fighting form. <text:s/>It was similar to her </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T218">human one, but covered in thick chitin and looked androgynous. <text:s/>She also had 10 inch long razor sharp claws on her hands. <text:s/>Everything except the white claws was black.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P141"><text:tab/>“This is the wild, things are kill or be killed here. <text:s/>He challenged me, and now I am going to meet that challenge. <text:s/>Maybe he will give up and leave, but this is happening.” <text:s/>Wild declared with more confidence than she had. <text:s/>Between her words and her appearance she cowed the rest of the group.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P141"><text:tab/>“Wow.” said Rainbow Dash. <text:s/>With that Wild entered the cave her mantra still going strong in her mind. <text:s/>The dragon rose up to his full height when he noticed her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P141"><text:tab/>“What is it that you hope to gain from this?” Wild asked the dragon.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93"><text:span text:style-name="T218"><text:tab/>“Nothing. <text:s/>I&apos;m just here to get rid of competition.” <text:s/>he answered with a laugh. <text:s/>He drew in a breath as Wild stood in front of him. <text:s/>She would later claim that she let the flame wash over her to demonstrate her resilience. <text:s/>In reality she was paralyzed with fear. <text:s/>Either way the changeling chitin she was using was able to handle dragon flame just fine. <text:s/>“So you are</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">n&apos;t a complete fool</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218">.” the dragon said seeing that his breath had no effect.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P141"><text:tab/>Wild charged forward under the dragons attempt to grab her and slashed at his underbelly. <text:s/>She was able to scratch some of the scales, but did no substantial damage. <text:s/>She needed something to get past the natural armor. <text:s/>A quick survey of the room and she found her answer. <text:s/>The gold covering the floor would provide plenty of weight all she had to do was grab it and put it into a hammer. <text:s/>The dragon had a similar idea and was pounding at the floor forcing Wild to hop around the cave. <text:s/>In order to create an opening she picked up a rock on the floor and took careful aim. <text:s/>When she threw the rock it did not have enough force to break through the scales, but it was enough to make the dragon reel back when it entered his eye.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P141"><text:tab/>Wild was able to scoop up some of the gold and form a hammer at the end of her arm. <text:s/>Not wanting to waste the opportunity she jumped off one of the walls to get up to the ceiling. <text:s/>Using all of the power she could she launch herself from the ceiling onto the dragon&apos;s head. <text:s/>Swinging her hammer in midair she delivered massive blow and forced the dragon into the cave floor. <text:s/>That hit cracked the dragons skull, and enraged him. <text:s/>“I will kill you.” the dragon roared.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93"><text:span text:style-name="T218"><text:tab/>The dragon began swiping at Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T219">trying to catch her. <text:s/>She managed to dodge a few, but the erratic nature of them proved too much. <text:s/>She was grabbed and could not get enough leverage to break the hold. <text:s/>The dragon did not waste any time and threw her into his mouth. <text:s/>Sliding down his throat Wild screamed, “This isn&apos;t over.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93"><text:span text:style-name="T219"><text:tab/>Trying to sink her claws into any surface she could Wild discovered that dragons were even armored on the inside. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T47">OK, this is bad there isn&apos;t enough good air here, and I can&apos;t cut through, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T219">Wild panicked, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T47">and this acid is actually strong enough to dissolve me. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T219">Going out the way she came in was not possible so Wild went with the only other exit. <text:s/>Prying it open she entered the dragons intestines and discovered that the armoring stopped. <text:s/>She cut through the side and heard a muffled roar from outside. <text:s/>To her surprise trying to consume the softer dragon flesh did not work. <text:s/>A shift in orientation and soft thud signaled the dragon falling over. <text:s/>Not wanting to stay any long Wild picked a direction </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T219">and started digging. <text:s/>By the time she escaped the guts a few holes had been burned all the way through her armor and she gave her own scream of pain. <text:s/>The dragon writhed on the ground never having felt much pain before.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P142"><text:tab/>“I don&apos;t think you can survive that.” Wild said looking toward the wound she made. <text:s/>She moved to his head and quickly sunk her claws into the previous wound. <text:s/>Once again she was unable to consume the dragon, but she could at least give him a quick death.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>Walking out of the cave Wild rejoined the ponies. <text:s/>She looked terrible with pits melted out of her armor. <text:s/>The acid had even eaten chunk out of her shoulder and legs revealing the muscle underneath. <text:s/>Her claws had plenty of notches and one looked ready to fall apart with the number of holes through them. <text:s/>“He ate me.” Wild said, “What in the world do dragons eat that he can actually digest me?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“Gemstones.” <text:s/>Twilight answered on autopilot as she just stared at the sight before her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“Right, Gemstones. <text:s/>That would do it.” Wild said as one of her claws clattered to the ground. <text:s/>“I recommend you guys go back to Ponyville. <text:s/>This bodies pretty much hit its limit, so I&apos;ll meet you there.” <text:s/>she continued when one of her legs gave out and she dropped to a kneel. <text:s/>“Sorry you had to see this.” was the last thing she said before collapsing and killing the remaining virus inside that body.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>A quick trip and Wild was back at her fountain flopped on the edge. <text:s/>She was idly running a hoof through the water while wait for the others to return. <text:s/>Her wait was not very long, but she only sensed one pony approaching.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“What&apos;s got you down?” <text:s/>Flitter asked once Wild turned to her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“I slayed a dragon today.” <text:s/>Wild sighed and caused Flitter to pull back in surprise.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“A dragon, where did you find a dragon. <text:s/>You didn&apos;t hurt that one that lives with Twilight did you?” <text:s/>Flitter asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“Nah, Spike&apos;s fine, but anther one decided to settle down in that mountain. <text:s/>Apparently he heard that I had claimed the Ponyville area, and wanted to challenge me. <text:s/>Problem is I wasn&apos;t alone and I am not looking forward to the conversation when they get back.” <text:s/>Wild answered indictating the mountain with the dissipating smoke cloud.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“So that was a dragon causing that smoke. <text:s/>I&apos;m glad he&apos;s gone, although I would have preferred a different way.” <text:s/>Flitter said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“Honestly, I agree with you and would have just let him leave, but he ended up eating me. <text:s/>With the damage I caused getting out, it was kinder to just mercy kill him.” <text:s/>Wild said. <text:s/>A few moments of silence passed before Wild asked, “Why do you seem so calm about this?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“Pegasi tend to be more aggressive since we were the main military force in the past. <text:s/>We know that dealing with threats is price of peace.” <text:s/>Flitter explained before both of the mares noticed a fast approaching yellow object. <text:s/>Before they could see what it was Wild has already been knocked off her hooves and landed in the fountain. <text:s/>Regaining her composure after the sucker punch she saw that <text:soft-page-break/>Fluttershy had arrived and was livid.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“You, You jerk. <text:s/>You didn&apos;t have to kill him. <text:s/>He was just trying to take a nap.” <text:s/>Fluttershy shouted as she advanced on Wild. <text:s/>Wild actually retreated from the irate pegasus as a crowd gathered to watch once again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“He was covering Equestria with smoke, and had challenged me. <text:s/>What was I supposed to do? I even tried talking one last time, but only got a stream of fire for my trouble?” <text:s/>Wild defended from the fountain that she was forced back into. <text:s/>Fluttershy was staring Wild directly in the eye with a surprising amount of intensity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“We do not fight others.” <text:s/>Fluttershy stated when Wild noticed strange activity in her brain. Normally her brain is inactive, but now the fear center of her brain was active.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P94"><text:span text:style-name="T219"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T47">What in the world? <text:s/>Is she trying to directly influencing my mind, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T219">Wild worried. <text:s/>She hoped the answer was no, but needed to find out. <text:s/>“Are you trying to control my mind?” Wild asked to the surprise of Fluttershy. <text:s/>Now it was Fluttershy&apos;s turn to back away until she flew away with tears in her eyes. <text:s/>“What just happened?” Wild asked to air now confused over Fluttershy&apos;s behavior.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>No one spoke after that, but one stallion did start laughing. <text:s/>The rest of the crowd turned to watch the amber colored stallion. <text:s/>“The horrible monster terrorizing Ponyville, and she gets sucker punched by Fluttershy. <text:s/>What&apos;re we supposed to afraid of again?” he asked to no one in particular.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“She&apos;s a demon.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“She&apos;s a zombie.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“She&apos;s a blank flank.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“Well, that last one&apos;s true.” <text:s/>Wild said while climbing out of the water. <text:s/>“What&apos;s so scary about being a blank flank?” she asked the crowd. <text:s/>The crowd just looked at each other. <text:s/>Twilight and the rest of the girls showed up and worked their way through the crowd.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“It just ain&apos;t right for grown mare your age to not have a cutie mark.” <text:s/>one of the ponies shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“But, I&apos;m still a teenager, and the cutie mark thing is just a lack of magic.” Wild said. <text:s/>All noise in the crowd stopped at that.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“What” said one of the crowd, voicing everyones question.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“Yep, I&apos;m only 19, and my coat is just dyed green since gray is boring.” <text:s/>said Wild causing the crowd to start awkwardly shuffle around. <text:s/>They began to wander off. <text:s/>The amber stallion was once again laughing as he left.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“So, slaying a dragon, that sounds interesting. <text:s/>I bet it was an epic fight.” Flitter prompted to diffuse the silence. <text:s/>Wild coughed and avoided eye contact.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“Um, I kind of got eaten. <text:s/>Again.” Wild grumbled and added as an after thought. <text:s/>“They got one powerful digestive tract.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“That would explain why your body started to eat through the rock.” <text:s/>Twilight observed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“So you had to climb back out his mouth. <text:s/>Awesome.” <text:s/>Rainbow said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“Not exactly.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“Oh so you...” Pinkie started. <text:s/>“Eww.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P94"><text:span text:style-name="T219"><text:tab/>“Perforated bowel actually.” Wild said. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T220">Rainbow had to land from how hard she was laughing, and Twilight winced having an idea of what such a wound would feel like. <text:s/>“Oh, Fluttershy came by, I don&apos;t think she&apos;s very happy with. <text:s/>She packs more of a punch than I expected.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P94"><text:span text:style-name="T220"><text:tab/>“Wait, Fluttershy punched you?” Rainbow asked receiving a nod from Wild and Flitter. <text:s/>“I think I&apos;ll go see if she&apos;s OK.” <text:s/>Rainbow announced before flying off. <text:s/>Rarity </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T221">left to scour the dirt from her coat and Pinkie had wandered off at some point too.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>“Well, I&apos;m off too, but I am glad the dragon isn&apos;t covering Equestria in smoke anymore.” <text:s/>Applejack said before returning to Sweet Apple Acres.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>Twilight frowned before sighing, “I don&apos;t like how you handled the dragon, but I can&apos;t really see an alternative.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>“That just means that you still have a working conscience. <text:s/>I think mine might be skewed.” <text:s/>Wild said. <text:s/>“Oh, this might be a strange question, but do you know anything about mind control magic.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>“Not much, just that most of it is more emotional influence instead actually control. <text:s/>You didn&apos;t learn how to use magic recently did you.” Twilight answered while her horn lit up. <text:s/>After awhile she frowned and accused, “Why can&apos;t I barely even detect you with magic?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>“Um...” Wild voiced and tapped her chin before she made a realization. <text:s/>Tendrils ran across her coat removing the changeling chitin before she asked, “Alright, how about now?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>Twilight lit her horn again and said, “Well, it works again, and you still don&apos;t have any magic. <text:s/>What did you do?” <text:s/>Twilight had narrowed her eyes in suspicion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>“Um, I found a fireproof chitin and used it to make my hair and skin. <text:s/>Looks like it has other properties too.” <text:s/>Wild answered, but avoided eye contact.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P94"><text:span text:style-name="T221"><text:tab/>“I&apos;ve never heard of something like that, do you have a sample I could borrow?” Twilight gasped. <text:s/>Wild took a sample out of her bag shaped like a small beetle shell, and Twilight took off as soon as she had it in her magic. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T48">I guess levitation still works on it, but I hope she doesn&apos;t figure out what it came from too soon, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T221">Wild worried.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>“So, how has your day been, Flitter?” Wild asked.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P218" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 13</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:span text:style-name="T221"><text:tab/>That night Wild decided to relocate the now unclaimed hoard, but before she could get started a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T221">group of guests arrived. <text:s/>A </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T228">8</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T221"> pony sized creatures showed up and roosted </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T222">in</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T221"> the trees just outside of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T222">Wild&apos;s forest. <text:s/>The periodic high pitch clicks gave Wild a pretty good idea of what they were. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T49">Where did they come from I&apos;ve never seen them before. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T222">Wild wondered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T49">I hope they follow me.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:span text:style-name="T49"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T222">Wild began carving a large room underground to store the gold and a tunnel leading up the surface close to the edge of the forest. <text:s/>Then she pulled a large </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T223">pipe</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T222"> out of a tree after looking around for any ponies. <text:s/>She already knew one of the thestrals could see her, but she had to give them a reason to follow. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T223">Heading to the ex-dragon&apos;s lair she dragged the end of the tube with her and made a pipeline. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T50">Ha, I got one, gonna catch me a bat, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T223">Wild thought and smirked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:span text:style-name="T223"><text:tab/>Slowly and loudly scooping gold into the pipeline Wild was watching the bat that had stopped just outside the cave waiting for them to enter. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T50">Will you walk into my parlor, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T223">thought Wild to the bat. <text:s/>Not until she was almost done did the spy make a move.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:span text:style-name="T223"><text:tab/>The spy slowly crept in unaware of Wild&apos;s grin as she went about her looting. <text:s/>They actually climbed to the roof once the got to the main chamber. <text:s/>Now that her quarry was inside Wild sealed the entrance with chitin from the pipe. <text:s/>The last of the gold entered the pipe and Wild was ready to see who was following her. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T50">Let&apos;s see how good her night vision is, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T223">Wild thought as she grew her hair out toward the ceiling slowly </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T230">encircling</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T223"> the pony. <text:s text:c="2"/>“And the trap is sprung.” Wild intoned. <text:s/>The spy panicked and tried to fly away, but Wild already had them in her grip. <text:s/>Making sure that the ponies wings and legs were bound Wild tilted them </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T230">so they were face-to-face</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T223">. <text:s/>“Well, what do we have here?” Wild rumbled with a deep resonating voice to the bat mare.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:span text:style-name="T223"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T224">Wild sent the pipeline retracting back to the forest, but left the wall in place. <text:s/>She wrapped the now unconscious mare in spider webs, and hung her from the ceiling by a thread. <text:s/>The mare had gray fur and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T225">light purple mane with a set of purple plate mail. <text:s/>Wild tossed a few bioluminescent sacs around <text:s/>for light and settled in to wait for the mare to wake. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T228">6</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T225"> of the other bats had not reacted at all, but one of them had moved to investigate the pipeline and was now following the end as it retracted. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T51">These must be some newbie soldiers if they&apos;re wandering off alone, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T225">Wild thought with hooves steepled, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T51">I&apos;ve never gotten to play the monster in a horror story before.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:span text:style-name="T51"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T225">Wild set up the next trap by moving the forest end deeper into the forest and added spider web shooters to the other end ready to entangle the pony. <text:s/>When the pony passed the edge of the forest Wild aimed for his mouth and fired. <text:s/>Wrapping him up all nice and snug and uncovering his nose he was dragged into the forest </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T226">and into the treasure room. <text:s/>He was stuck to one of the walls and Wild formed a pair of eyes on the wall across from him. <text:s/>He was a brown bat stallion with a black mane and was glaring at the new eyes. <text:s/>Wild released the rest of his snout to let him speak.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:span text:style-name="T226"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T227">The mare was the first one to start making noise. <text:s/>When she woke up she started screaming prompting Wild to get up, walk over to the mare and shush her. <text:s/>Every time she would try to scream Wild would put a hoof to the mares mouth until she was ready to talk at a normal volume. <text:s/>“So, why were you following me?” Wild said going directly for answers.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P145"><text:tab/>Nothing coherent had been said by either pony so Wild tried again. <text:s/>“Well both of you are better at not talking than not going off on your own. <text:s/>So, you guys some kind of spooky assassins or <text:soft-page-break/>something?” <text:s/>The mare frowned at the taunt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P145"><text:tab/>“We are night guards of Princess Luna.” <text:s/>the guards mare argued and since Wild had broadcast everything to both chambers the other guard heard too.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P145"><text:tab/>He sighed, “Why are we in spider webs?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P145"><text:tab/>“I could put you in fleshy pods if you want.” Wild offered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P145"><text:tab/>“NO” both of guards shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:span text:style-name="T227"><text:tab/>“Alright so if not assassin then spies, not really sure what you think you&apos;ll find. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T228">Unless you were hoping to play war games, then you came to the right place.” <text:s/>Wild said as she packed up the things in the dragon cave and put the mare on her back. <text:s/>She headed back to the forest to unite the guards, and to see what the mare would do with this opportunity. <text:s/>When they got back to the Wild&apos;s forest the guard let out a shriek. <text:s/>Wild had been waiting for something like this and repeated the shriek along the edge of the forest thoroughly masking its origin.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“What did you just do?” stammered the mare hearing her own voice coming from within the forest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Broadcast your call. <text:s/>All your friends definitely heard, but they won&apos;t be able to tell from where.” <text:s/>Wild answered. <text:s/>Sure enough the rest of the guards were frantic at that and grouped up. <text:s/>Except for the furthest pair who entered the forest on their own. <text:s/>Wild decided to drop thin sticky threads from her branches. <text:s/>They would slowly encase the two and blend into their coats. <text:s/>When enough were in place they would stiffen trapping the ponies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:span text:style-name="T228"><text:tab/>When she made it back to the treasure room Wild placed the mare against the wall near the other guard. <text:s/>Wild began send whispers to the wandering pair to get them lost. <text:s/>She also created a copy of the mare to use a bait. <text:s/>The clone laid down in sight of the forest&apos;s edge pretending to be unconscious. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T229">The clone was also attached to the ground and ready to stick to the first thing to touch it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“The trap is set, lets see who gets caught.” Wild said now that the waiting began.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“You sick mare, why don&apos;t you just let us go?” the mare fumed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“You didn&apos;t ask.” Wild stated and shifted the webbing around the two ponies into a rectangular blanket. <text:s/>“You can keep those if you want.” <text:s/>The mare quickly unwrapped herself and threw the blanket on the ground. <text:s/>The stallion folded up his and stuffed it in his armor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“Do you want that?” <text:s/>the stallion asked his partner.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“No, I do not want it.” <text:s/>the mare roared. <text:s/>He packed up the other blanket too. <text:s/>“Really.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>“What? they&apos;re silk.” he said. <text:s/>Wild had been watching the two in the forest and figured that they had enough silk on them. <text:s/>She decided to stiffen just one of them when the other wasn&apos;t watching. <text:s/>Forming a human body for herself behind a tree he quickly grabbed the trapped one and headed back to the treasure room making sure to not be seen. <text:s/>She walked in as a human with her captured guardsmare and released the guards mouth. <text:s/>The first two guards were still arguing over something. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“Do they do this often?” Wild asked the still tied up mare as her human body merged with a wall.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:span text:style-name="T229"><text:tab/>“Sometimes, but what the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">hay</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T229"> is going on here?” <text:s/>she replied as Wild removed the silk on her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>“Impromptu war games, and I think the mare is mad because she fainted.” <text:s/>Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>“Midnight Oil. <text:s/>Yeah I can see that, she&apos;s not exactly the courageous type. <text:s/>I&apos;m Midnight Blossom” </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>“Wild Way. <text:s/>Ah, all the players have joined the game.” <text:s/>Wild said with a smile. <text:s/>The group of four had entered the forest, and one of them was approaching the Midnight Oil clone. <text:s/>She nudged the clone with a hoof, and got stuck. <text:s/>She decided to grab the body and get unstuck later, but instead found out the body was attached to the ground. <text:s/>She ended up stuck fully to the body and could not move in any useful way. <text:s/>“Uh oh. <text:s/>How is Oily with embarrassing situations?” Wild whispered with wide eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>“What did you do?” whispered back. <text:s/>Wild had encased the pair in a mouth to begin transporting them. <text:s/>By the time the other three got to the mouth it had opened again to reveal the same ground without the ponies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>“Well, I made a clone of her that would stick to anyone who touched it. <text:s/>Then attached it to the ground in a conspicuous location.” <text:s/>Wild explained. <text:s/>The attached ponies had arrived in the treasure room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:span text:style-name="T229"><text:tab/>“Oh, yep. <text:s/>That&apos;s a compromising position alright.” Blossom said. <text:s/>Wild released the mare, but Midnight Oil had already seen the pair. <text:s/>Everything stopped for just a second while everyone processed what they had seen. <text:s/>In an instant the stuck mare and Midnight Oil had switched places. <text:s/>Unfortunately, Midnight had drawn her blade ready to slaughter her doppleganger. <text:s/>She even used her special ability and lit the blade on fire. <text:s/>Only Blossom had any idea of what was going to happen. First, all of Wild&apos;s biomass near Midnight turned in tendrils and began rushing away. <text:s/>Second, water poured into room from every surface. <text:s/>Wild had made sure to have plenty of aquifer water available no matter where.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>Blossom had braced herself for the chaos and held her ground, but the other two guards panicked and tried to flee the room. <text:s/>Instead the water rushing in pushed them to the center, and since the floor had already fled they were stuck in mud. <text:s/>In the end the fire was extinguished and the three guards where flailing trying to get out the mud pit but just got themselves more tangled. <text:s/>Blossom just watched as the mess was spread to the whole room. <text:s/>Wild had jammed herself into a corner, forgetting that she could merge with it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:span text:style-name="T229"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T230">Well, I think it&apos;s safe to say that this mission is FUBAR.” said a large stallion that had just entered the room. <text:s/>All of the noise from the recent events allowed the rest of the squad to locate them and come running. <text:s/>Wild had regained her senses and merge back with the wall hoping everyone would forget that she was the entire room. <text:s/>“Half of my squad disappears, and now I find you mud wrestling. <text:s/>I hope there&apos;s a good reason for all of this.” <text:s/>he said before raising his voice to shout, “I want all of you outside and lined up, Now. <text:s/>That includes you miss Wild Way.” <text:s/>Wild reformed herself from the wall and ran outside with the three guards she didn&apos;t catch.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T230"><text:tab/>The 8 ponies lined up and the commanding pony stood in front of them scanning the row. <text:s/>“Midnight Blossom, what in the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">buck were the five of you doing in there?” he barked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P149"><text:tab/>“War games, sir” Blossom said after a moment of thought. <text:s/>The stallions expression clearly indicate that there better be more to the explanation. <text:s/>“The target began abducting us. <text:s/>When myself and Private Dusk Breeze heard Private Midnight Oil&apos;s call we decided to attempt a rescue. <text:s/>I was immobilized and carried to the chamber where Privates Midnight Oil and Sanguine were arguing. <text:s/>It became apparent when I was released that the mission had been effectively turned into a war game. <text:s/>Things went wrong when Private Cereus was captured. <text:s/>Midnight Oily reacted poorly to her state and attempted to use her blade. <text:s/>After lighting it on fire.” <text:s/>she elaborated.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P149"><text:tab/>“I see. <text:s/>It seems so of you did not read the briefing very thoroughly. <text:s/>And you, what the buck made you think playing war games was a good idea?” he asked to Wild.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:span text:style-name="T231"><text:tab/>“Well, when Oily followed me all the way to that dragon&apos;s cave, I had to find out who she was. <text:s/>Then I just figured it would be fun to see how many of you I could catch.” Wild answered practically vomiting </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T232">out</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231"> the second sentence. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T232">Midnight Oil had bristled at the nickname, but then tensed up at the implication of the what Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:span text:style-name="T232"><text:tab/>“Fun, right.” he drawled. <text:s/>“You turned this entire thing into a prank.” He started rubbing his eyes. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T233">I was told this would not be a normal mission, I assume you were aware of us right from our arrival.” <text:s/>Receiving a nod he continued, “What problems did you notice?” <text:s/>He was met with confused looks and cries of &apos;Sarge&apos;, but did not respond to them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:span text:style-name="T233"><text:tab/>“Going off alone, that was the biggest problem. <text:s/>My capabilities will change every time, so the lack of Intel was a moot point. <text:s/>Reaction to unusual things wasn&apos;t a moot point. <text:s/>Following odd pipes that move on their own is not a good idea, nor is rushing to a conspicuous body. <text:s/>Maybe a bit more caution when the shriek came from the entire forest border.” Wild explained and then smirked, “The last thing is that spiders don&apos;t leave threads hanging everywhere in a forest.” <text:s/>The threads on the other guard with Blossom stiffened and causing her eyes to widen. <text:s/>She tried to struggle, but could not do more than fidget and fall over. <text:s/>Wild had already grown a tendril underneath the guard to catch her. <text:s/>She let the webbing peel off after cutting in strategic location and retracted the tendril.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:span text:style-name="T233"><text:tab/>“You just can&apos;t help yourself can you?” Sarge said with an arched eyebrow. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T234">Well, this mission is over. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">Time to head home, and Wild I can&apos;t order you to come to Canterlot, but it is strongly desired.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:span text:style-name="T235"><text:tab/>Wild thought about the request and figured she would need to go there at some point. <text:s/>Plus, she had a delightfully insane plan. <text:s/>“OK, I </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">shall make my way to Canterlot</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">?” Wild asked with an unhealthily large grin.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:span text:style-name="T235"><text:tab/>Sarge opened his mouth to answer, but thought better of it. <text:s/>Starting again he answered, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">If you get there before us </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">head to the castle and wait by the main entrance. <text:s/>Also, DO NOT damage either Ponyville or Canterlot.” Before departing Sarge added one more thing, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">Minimize the damage to the terrain</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">, too.” <text:s/>All of the guards looked to Wild, but she had already locked her body in place </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">as her attention moved elsewhere</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">. <text:s/>After a few minutes they </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T236">flew away</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235"> with a distinct feeling of unease.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T235"><text:tab/>Once they had exited the forest completely Sarge looked back and did not know what he was seeing. <text:s/>A long stick was raised out of the canopy somewhere deep in the forest. <text:s/>It was two or thre times the height of the surrounding trees, and thicker than </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">most</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235"> of their trunks. <text:s/>“What in the world is that crazy mare up to?” Sarge mumbled to himself. <text:s/>Midnight Blossom had stopped with him and was look</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">i</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">ng at the odd sight too.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P150"><text:tab/>“Was it really wise to let her go alone?” <text:s/>Midnight asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P150"><text:tab/>“Probably not, but it&apos;s not like we could force her to. <text:s/>I would also like to have some idea of her long range transport capabilities.” <text:s/>Sarge said while Midnight frowned at the odd wording.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P150"><text:tab/>“You figured something out didn&apos;t you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P150"><text:tab/>“Hmm, it&apos;s oddly proportioned, but you should be able to figure out what that is, Corporal.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P150"><text:tab/>She squinted at it as if that would reveal its secrets. <text:s/>She got an idea when she stopped considering conventional transports. <text:s/>“Oh no, that mare can&apos;t be that insane.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:span text:style-name="T235"><text:tab/>At the column Wild was going to use for a house she built her very first potato cannon, some of those soldiers were very enthusiastic about weaponry. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">She was using a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">5-inch projectile but the barrel of the cannon was a</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">t least</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235"> 5 feet across. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">Silk binding was used between layers of chitin to make the barrel with the inner most layer being rifled</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">. <text:s/>The pressure chamber was </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">a huge bulb at one end that had muscle tissue covering its entire surface and a ball valve connecting to the barrel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">. <text:s/>She created some eyes to watch the maiden voyage, and squeezed the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">bulb as tight as possible</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">. <text:s/>Her Transonic Potato Cannon was locked and loaded.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P97"><text:span text:style-name="T235"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">Along with the rings a green contrail also highlighted the path of the projectile. <text:s/>A long hiss of escaping air followed a low rumble from the guns firing. It could be heard in Ponyville, but was not enough to wake most of the ponies still asleep.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235"> <text:s/>Along with the explosion the bullet had caused multiple sonic booms. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">The guns barrel had extensive cracking, but held together for the most part. <text:s/>It would not be firing again though.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P97"><text:span text:style-name="T236"><text:tab/>“WILD WAY, WHAT DID YOU DO?” shouted </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">Rose who had been stalking toward the forest when she saw the spectacle</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T236">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">Seeing the line of fire ended near Canterlot Rose thundered,</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T236"> “I&apos;M GOING TO TAN YOUR HIDE IF YOU LIT CANTERLOT ON FIRE!”</text:span></text:p>

   <text:h text:style-name="P219" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 14</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:span text:style-name="T236"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">Wild had explained what she had been doing to Rose, which lead to the discovery that Rose was able to make good on her threat. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T238">Apparently using Rose&apos;s own chitin to coat everything had its down sides.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237"> <text:s/>Rose </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T238">was particularly concerned about the faerie fire that Wild had managed to create. <text:s/>Faerie fire takes magic to create. Somehow Wild managed to infuse the bullet with a substantial amount of magic despite not having any magic herself. <text:s/>Which is why Rose stood before the over-sized cannon and stared at it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“You have no sense of propriety, do you?” Rose grumbled before inspecting the construction. <text:s/>“How far down does this column go?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“Five or Six hundred feet down to bedrock.” Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“What did you make it out of?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“Sapphires mostly, and cement to keep them together.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“Can you expose part of the core?” Rose asked with narrowed eyes. <text:s/>Her suspicion was confirmed when a section of the platform the cannon was resting on opened and bathed the area in blue light. <text:s/>“Yup, that&apos;s it you accidentally tapped in to a ley line. <text:s/>You have a nigh inexhaustible flow of magic in you, thank the Earth Mother its only going to an integrity field.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:span text:style-name="T238"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T239">The bullet had actually survived intact because of the magic from the ley line. <text:s/>It was embedded in the side of the mountain at the center of a sizable crater of missing stone, but was completely undamaged. <text:s/>With her shifting Wild had no problem getting out of the mountain side, but since she only had about a hundred pounds to work with she decided to go with a younger version of her usual form. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P152"><text:tab/>When a couple of pegasus guards arrived to investigate the crater, they found Wild as a filly just as she was wandering off. <text:s/>“Whoa there little filly, what are you doing out here its dangerous?” <text:s/>one of the guards said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:span text:style-name="T239"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m going to a castle!” Wild chirped with a small excited hop. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T52">Yep, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T53">I&apos;m </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T52">just an adorable filly, nothing to see here, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T239">Wild worried</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T52">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T239">“Bat Sarge wants me to meet him there.” <text:s/>she whispered to the guard.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P152"><text:tab/>“Bat Sarge, huh. <text:s/>How did you get way out here if you&apos;re going to the castle?” he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P152"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“I flew. <text:s/>See, I made a crater.” Wild said pointing to said crater that the other guard was looking at. <text:s/>“I think I went faster than I was supposed to.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:span text:style-name="T239"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T240">How could you fly without wings?” the guard asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P153"><text:tab/>“A cannon.” she answered and started walking off. <text:s/>“I gotta go now. <text:s/>Bye mister.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:span text:style-name="T240"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T241">Hold on there, you shouldn&apos;t just go off on your own. <text:s/>Who is taking care of you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P154"><text:tab/>“Nobody, I can do it myself.” <text:s/>Wild declared but was picked up by the guard. <text:s/>“Hey, what are you doing?” <text:s/>Wild pouted with puffed up cheeks from the guards back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:span text:style-name="T241"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m going to take you back to the barracks until we find your parents.” <text:s/>the guard stated and began to fly away with his partner and Wild. <text:s/>She settled down once in the air fascinated with being in the air without some kind of mechanical assistance. <text:s/>It was not long before they landed to Wild&apos;s disappointment and entered a plain stone structure near the castle. <text:s/>It had a simple courtyard surrounded on three sides by the buildings. <text:s/>It also had a second level with a balcony along the edge of the courtyard. <text:s/>There were a few guards wandering mostly with golden armor, but one was wearing the purple armor of the night guard. <text:s/>She had a lithe build with a jade green coat, and deep purple mane. <text:s/><text:tab/>Wild ran right up to the mare and announced, “You&apos;re pretty.” <text:s/>The mare just blinked completely unsure how to react. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T53">Being a child is awesome, I can get away with all kinds of stuff, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T241">Wild smiled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P154"><text:tab/>“Uh, thanks kid.” the mare guessed. <text:s/>When she looked around she saw that one of the solar guards was approaching. <text:s/>“Did you lose something?” <text:s/>she asked the guard.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P154"><text:tab/>“Sorry Captain Jade, she got away from me.” he apologized after saluting, “She is apparently looking for a &apos;Bat Sarge&apos;.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P154"><text:tab/>“We&apos;re the same color.” Wild chirped, “Also bat Sarge said to go to the main entrance of the castle.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T241"><text:tab/>“The same color?” the captain questioned and checked to see if she had changed colors, “What are yo--” <text:s/>She got a look of comprehension and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T242">rubbed her temples. <text:s/>“You&apos;re Wild Way aren&apos;t you?” she asked and got a nod, “and you can see straight through glamors.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P155"><text:tab/>“What&apos;s a glamor?” <text:s/>Wild asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:span text:style-name="T242"><text:tab/>Jade dismissed the private before answering, “An illusion attached to an object. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T243">How did you find the squad that I sent?</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T242">”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:span text:style-name="T242"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T243">Echolocation, I use it pretty much all the time. Even more than I use my eyes. <text:s/>Also, I can hear a large range of sounds so when they used their own echolocation it was pretty hard to miss.” <text:s/>Wild explained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P156"><text:tab/>“Ponyfeathers, we really are under prepared. <text:s/>C&apos;mon let&apos;s go wait at the castle.” Jade swore before walking out of the barracks. <text:s/>“We even use echolocation and we never considered countermeasures for it.” she huffed to herself. <text:s/>While waiting for the sergeant to arrive Jade commented, “You&apos;re presence here has caused both princesses a lot of worry. <text:s/>Princess Celestia is <text:soft-page-break/>concerned with your willingness and ability to kill an adult dragon. <text:s/>Princess Luna was shocked about almost everything else. <text:s/>A dragon came into Equestria, nested next to a small town, and the reason its undamaged is he didn&apos;t care enough to attack it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P156"><text:tab/>“So that was an Equestrian spy on the mountain then.” <text:s/>Wild observed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P156"><text:tab/>“I shouldn&apos;t be surprised that you noticed. <text:s/>Full invisibility and I bet it had no effect on you. <text:s/>Whether intentional of not, you have managed to become a big part of the national defense.” <text:s/>Jade chuckled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P156"><text:tab/>“Maybe for Ponyville, but I&apos;m not exactly mobile.” <text:s/>Wild said, but was met with a look of confusion. She elaborated, “This body is just an avatar, my main body is comparable to the size of a mountain. <text:s/>Even for me a mountain walking around sounds excessive.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P156"><text:tab/>“You really did consume a forest.” said Jade trying to comprehend the scale.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P156"><text:tab/>“And everything below down to the bedrock.” Wild said. <text:s/>When she looked over Jade mouth was opening and closing, but she did no noise came out. “Damn it, I broke another one.” Wild frowned. <text:s/>The squad arrived shortly after that, still messy from their mission.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P156"><text:tab/>“Captain!” Sarge called the rest of the squad behind him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:span text:style-name="T243"><text:tab/>The captain recomposed herself and said, “Sergeant, I take it you had a fun time. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T244">I can take over from here, you lot go get cleaned up. <text:s/>It looks like the debriefing will be interesting if nothing else.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T245"><text:s/>She ushered Wild into the castle as the squad departed. <text:s/>“The princesses should still be in the dining hall at this time.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:span text:style-name="T245"><text:tab/>The pair entered the dining hall and saw that the princesses were in fact there with a third pony. <text:s/>A large unicorn stallion with a pure white coat, and blond mane was sitting at the table with them. <text:s/>He was immaculately groomed and sitting behind the candelabra in the center of the table. <text:s/>“Captain, why have you brought this... urchin?” he asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:span text:style-name="T245"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T246">This is Wild Way a rather unique individual that the princesses have taken interest in.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T245">” <text:s/>the captain responded. <text:s/>The two princesses watched from opposite ends of the table. <text:s/>One princess was clad in black and silver regalia with a matching crown. <text:s/>She had a blue coat, but her mane looked like it was made of the night sky with stars twinkling in it. <text:s/>Her cutie mark was a black sky with a white crescent moon. <text:s/>Her counterpart on the other end had a white coat the same as the stallion, but her hair was ethereal and colored like the dawn sky. <text:s/>She had gold regalia and crown with purple gems inlays. <text:s/>Her cutie mark was a sun with four flares in the cardinal directions. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T246">Both of the princess had a pair of wings as well as a horn.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:span text:style-name="T245"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T246">Ah, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">my thanks</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T246"> Captain. <text:s/>If there is nothing else...” Luna, the blue princess responded dismissing the Captain. <text:s/>Turning back to Wild she asked, “You may sit, but I do have to ask, why are </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">th</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T246">ou a foal?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P157"><text:tab/>Wild sat right where she stood, getting blank looks from the others. <text:s/>“I traveled light, and being a foal is fun.” <text:s/>Wild answered while refusing to take her eyes off the candles.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P157"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“Impudent child, you are supposed to sit in a chair! <text:s/>And stop staring at me.” <text:s/>the stallion shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:span text:style-name="T246"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m not staring at you, you aren&apos;t that interesting.” Wild responded. <text:s/>The stallion </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">fumed</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T246">, but Luna tilted her head in confusion. <text:s/>Celestia&apos;s expression was in between the two of them. Luna soon realized what the problem was and extinguished the candles.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:span text:style-name="T246"><text:tab/>“There, now </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">thou</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T246"> can join us at the table.” <text:s/>Luna said while Wild relocated to a chair in the center of the table. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">We are quite interested in your fight with the dragon yesterday, but first to make sure that we are on the same page would thou tell us in thine own words what happened.” <text:s/>Luna requested and Wild told the entire table about her fight with the dragon. <text:s/>The stallion had left looking a little unsettled before most of the tale.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P139"><text:tab/>“That is a... unique way to defeat a dragon.” Luna said. <text:s/>“</text:p>
