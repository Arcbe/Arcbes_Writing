   <text:p text:style-name="P20">The sky was dark and the moon full even though it was long after the sun should have risen. <text:span text:style-name="T498">A battle for the ages was taking place in a r</text:span>uined castle in the forest <text:span text:style-name="T498">to decide whether the sun would ever rise again</text:span>. <text:span text:style-name="T498">A much more subtle though no less important event was taking place in a</text:span> small clearing within sight of the castle. A single pop was the first hint of anything <text:span text:style-name="T498">abnormal </text:span>happening <text:span text:style-name="T498">and was soon followed by increasingly rapid series of pops</text:span>. <text:span text:style-name="T498">Soon the pops were joined by electrical arcs emanating from a point just a meter above the center of the clearing.</text:span> <text:span text:style-name="T498">The battle for the morning was building up to a climax as well.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20"><text:span text:style-name="T498">The energy in the clearing had built up enough to begin scorching the ground as the final blow of the battle was dealt. </text:span>A brilliant flash of light obscured everything while a <text:span text:style-name="T498">deafening bang ran out</text:span>. <text:span text:style-name="T498">Once it cleared the first rays of morning could b seen as the </text:span>sun rose <text:span text:style-name="T498">in the sky</text:span>. <text:span text:style-name="T498">The popping and sparking had been replaced by</text:span> <text:span text:style-name="T498">a</text:span> confused woman st<text:span text:style-name="T498">an</text:span>d<text:span text:style-name="T498">ing</text:span> in the center <text:span text:style-name="T498">of the clearing</text:span>. <text:s/>She was a scrawny brun<text:span text:style-name="T498">ette bordering on emaciated. Her long hair did not look like it had seen a comb in the past month and her green t-shirt and blue jeans had seen better days.</text:span> <text:s/>As she surveyed her new surrounds she pulled her hair back into a pony tail. <text:s/>It stayed in this new configuration <text:span text:style-name="T498">despite the fact that</text:span> nothing <text:span text:style-name="T498">held</text:span> it together.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">Audrey Anderson was <text:span text:style-name="T498">used to strange situation so while confused she was not worried.</text:span> She had been living in Manhattan during the <text:span text:style-name="T498">first outbreak of the Blacklight virus</text:span>. It was <text:span text:style-name="T498">easily the</text:span> most terrifying virus the world had seen. <text:span text:style-name="T498">I</text:span>t infected and killed its victims in only a matter of minutes, <text:span text:style-name="T498">before</text:span> <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T498">sometimes reanimating</text:span> the corpse to spread itself further. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T498">Audrey and another called Zeus were the only ones to merged with the virus instead of dying.</text:span> In a matter of minutes she went from <text:span text:style-name="T498">panicked </text:span>survivor to <text:span text:style-name="T498">public enemy number one</text:span>. She did gain <text:span text:style-name="T498">superhuman </text:span>powers, including shape shifting, as a consolation prize.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20"><text:span text:style-name="T498">Within a day of being infected she was discovered by viral sensor and captured. After experiencing the treatment of Blackwatch, a black-ops paramilitary group, nothing a forest could do would phase her. She did manage to develop her skills with precision manipulation of her virus as well as enhanced sense of sound. Her favorite being both active and passive sonar which she used constantly.</text:span> She was able to map out the surrounding forest nigh instantly using sonar. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T498">She was also able to detect the instant that another person appeared behind her</text:span>. <text:s/>She turned on her heels ready for a fight and <text:span text:style-name="T498">demanded</text:span>, “Who are you and how did you appear like that?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">“Good <text:span text:style-name="T498">senses on you, though you messed up my entrance</text:span>. <text:s/>I am the one who brought you here, as for my name <text:span text:style-name="T498">that&apos;s not very important, but there are a variety I have gone by in the past:</text:span> Gaea. Terra. Mother Earth not to be confused with Earth Mother which is also me. Janet from accounting, <text:span text:style-name="T498">that</text:span> was an interesting experience. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T498">Although everyone that knows me goes with That Bitch for some reason</text:span>.” <text:soft-page-break/>the other woman answered <text:span text:style-name="T498">ticking </text:span>off each of her names <text:span text:style-name="T498">on her fingers</text:span>.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20"><text:span text:style-name="T498">Her body looked chiseled out of stone and she had rich brown skin</text:span>. <text:span text:style-name="T498">She stood well over two meters tall letting her tower over Audrey</text:span>. <text:s/>Her eyes were a deep green color and <text:span text:style-name="T498">seemed to glow slightly</text:span>. <text:s/>Her hair <text:span text:style-name="T498">was the same brown as Audrey, but she also had vines mixed in that fall across he body. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T66">One of us is insane</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T498">, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T66">but I&apos;m not sure which, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T498">thought Audrey taking in the sight of the woman completely bereft of clothes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">“<text:span text:style-name="T498">Are you claiming to be a goddess, or another Prototype? Either way why bring me to this forest</text:span>?” Audrey <text:span text:style-name="T486">deadpanned</text:span>.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">“<text:span text:style-name="T498">I would say m</text:span>ore avatar, than god.” <text:span text:style-name="T498">Gaia answered,</text:span> “<text:span text:style-name="T498">But, this is an exciting time to be here. The monsters are coming, so I brought my own</text:span>. <text:span text:style-name="T498">You.</text:span>” </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">“<text:span text:style-name="T498">I&apos;m not going to be your pet monster, send me back</text:span>. <text:span text:style-name="T498">Now.</text:span>” Audrey <text:span text:style-name="T498">growled</text:span>.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">“<text:span text:style-name="T498">You don&apos;t have a choice, I can&apos;t send you back so you&apos;re stuck here. Not that there&apos;s anything for you to go back to in the first place</text:span>. <text:span text:style-name="T498">Think of this as an opportunity, all I want is for you to be here.</text:span>” Gaea responded <text:span text:style-name="T498">patting Audrey on the cheek</text:span>.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">“...<text:span text:style-name="T498">Damn it, fine. I didn&apos;t really have anything else to do.</text:span>” <text:span text:style-name="T498">Audrey sighed and crossed her arms, “I can see why people call you that bitch.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">“<text:span text:style-name="T498">Wonderful, I think you will find this to be a positive change</text:span>.” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T410">Gaea said as her body started to crumble into dirt, “Farewell, Athena.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20"><text:span text:style-name="T67">Oh course she leaves, it would be terrible if I got a whole answer. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T66">Why would she use my codename from Blackwatch, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T67">though</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T66">,</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T410"> Audrey sighed and poked at the dirt pile with her foot. <text:s/>Figuring there&apos;s no point in standing around Audrey set off for the only visible landmark, the ruins of a castle. A large chasm surrounded the ruins but she was able to cross it by using a biomass tendril as a grappling hook and transferring the rest of her mass through it to reform on the other side.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:span text:style-name="T54">What in the hell is this, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261">she thought when she peeked over the wall and saw some chariots with winged horses </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T309">standing </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261">by them in the overgrown courtyard. The horses were wearing golden armor and looked to be standing at attention </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T309">like little soldiers</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261">. In order to get closer she shifted into the form of a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T309">large house</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T262"> cat</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261"> hoping </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T309">the apparent pegasi would not be spooked that way</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261">. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T309">S</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261">he walked right up to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T309">them and started rubbing herself against their legs in order to collect DNA samples. The pegasi gave her a single glance before ignoring her. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T66">Yep, even pegasi just let cats get away with anything, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T309">she thought before hopping into one of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261">the carriages as if she owned them. Now that she was closer she could see that they were </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T309">closer to ponies, but th</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261">e proportions were wrong. Also they all had </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T309">identical </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T261">white coats and bright blue manes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">She did not have to wait long before 8 more ponies exited the decrepit building and got into the carriages. <text:span text:style-name="T500">A white one</text:span> was the size of an actual horse and entered a carriage with a much smaller blue pony. The other 6 <text:span text:style-name="T500">were just over half the height of the white one, and</text:span> join<text:span text:style-name="T499">ed</text:span> Audrey in the carriage before noticing her <text:span text:style-name="T499">just laying there</text:span>. She got a variety of tilted heads and curious eyes from them <text:soft-page-break/>before an orange coated one tried to shoo her away. Audrey <text:span text:style-name="T499">had no intention of leaving, fully intending to have these horses take her to civilization. She had even adhered herself to the floor in preparation.</text:span> A yellow one with wings tried cooing to her in an <text:span text:style-name="T499">its own</text:span> language and even <text:span text:style-name="T499">tried </text:span>to pick up <text:span text:style-name="T499">her up</text:span>. <text:span text:style-name="T499">The pony was unable to get her to even budge </text:span>to the surprise of the <text:span text:style-name="T499">other</text:span> ponies. <text:span text:style-name="T499">Next up was</text:span> another winged <text:span text:style-name="T499">pony</text:span> with a blue coat <text:span text:style-name="T499">who managed to bend the boards under her but still Audrey clung on</text:span>. <text:span text:style-name="T500">The other ponies where a pink hyper one, and two others with horns on their foreheads, one purple and the other white. Those three did not attempt to remove Audrey.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body"><text:span text:style-name="T13">I did not expect the ponies to be drawing carriages of more ponies</text:span>, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Wild marveled, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">nor for the carriages to fly</text:span>. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T83">The entire flight Audrey spent watching the ground speed by </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">far beneath the carriage</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">. <text:s/>The yellow flying pony from before had started to pet her and she returned it with a nuzzle </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">and quick DNA sampling</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">. Soon their destination was in sight, a small rustic town could be seen beyond the edge of the forest. The buildings had thatch roofs and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">Tudor style walls</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">. <text:s/>In the center of the town square was a three story tall round building, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">most likely the town hall</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">Only</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">a</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83"> few other buildings deviated from the common appearance like the gingerbread house and a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">huge </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">tree with a door </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">and windows</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">o</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">n it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:span text:style-name="T83">The carriages landed with a thud in the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">town square just next to the town hall</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">so</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">Audrey and company could disembarked</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">Most of</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">h</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">er fellow passengers watched as Audrey </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">hopped off to head somewhere, but a grinning pink pony picked her up before she could get far</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">Audrey looked around to find that she was set down in front of several plates with food on them. She had no recollection of what happened between being grabbed and now nor DNA sample for the pink pony she was sure she had collected. Those concerns did not last long after she looked at the plates though. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T499">So many strawberries,</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310"> Audrey thought as she approached the enticing sight. She looked at the other plates once she had a mouth full of strawberries, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T499">Dark chocolate, and vanilla ice cream? A regular cat wouldn&apos;t eat any of this. Probably shouldn&apos;t eat it either, just what is this pony trying to do. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T310">Despite those thoughts she proceeded to eat all of the food anyway.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:span text:style-name="T310">L</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">eaving the alley to the side of the gingerbread house Audrey set off to collect more samples. She did not technically need them, but if she was going to try blending with the ponies she might as well gather all the information she can. </text:span>Be nice if I could learn the language from this, but Gentek didn&apos;t have any linguists on staff to consume, <text:span text:style-name="T83">she lamented while looking for ponies to pester. Most of them were perfectly fine being the rubbing post, only one actually brought out a broom.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:span text:style-name="T83">It became obvious that the ponies where preparing a party once tables started being set up in the square. Audrey figured the party was for the ponies she rode in with considering the amount of gold used on those carriages, but decided to prance around like it was for her. </text:span>Of course the towns people would prepare a party for my arrival, <text:span text:style-name="T83">she thought</text:span>, I am a cat after all. That pretty much the same as a goddess. <text:span text:style-name="T83">Her attention was drawn to an empty patch of grass when something just appeared there as she looked away. On the ground was a cake with pink frosting and sliced strawberries with none of the ponies nearby. </text:span>Um, I didn&apos;t actually expect to get a cake, but hell yeah I&apos;m eating that whole thing, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey thought as she hurried over to the cake intent on demolishing it. It turned out to be a Neapolitan marble cake under all that frosting, too.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:soft-page-break/>She was shamelessly enjoying a belly rub from a yellow pony in the towns park when she heard screams from some of the other ponies. When she looked in that direction she saw an enormous bird rivaling the houses in size and heading straight toward her. <text:span text:style-name="T13">Is that a roc, the hell is it doing... No way am I letting you just take my pony, </text:span>she thought as she rolled back to her feet. The pony with her had already started to bolt, but she had chosen to go the same direction as the roc. Audrey opened her mouth far wider than should be possible ripping her cheeks in half as she jumped at the roc&apos;s feet. She was able to get a firm hold when she bit into the leg near the talons. Increasing the pressure she heard a snap followed by a screech as the birds foot went limp. The pony was still sent tumbling when the bird caught up to her, but it could not grasp her even if it wanted to.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">This has got look completely absurd, but there&apos;s no Blackwatch around, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey thought as she began climbing the leg with her claws. She bit down again once she reached the thigh and released some of her virus into the muscle. Instead of simply letting the infection work on its own she had it travel through the bloodstream and target the brain directly. </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">By this time they had reached a height far above the town and were headed back to the forest with a flock of 4 golden armored pony trying to fly after them. Before the guards could catch up the bird suddenly went limp and began to fall to the open ground between the town and the forest. It still had enough momentum to bounce once and slide into a tree at the edge of the forest. The guards were completely baffled when they arrived to find a relatively tiny cat laying on top of the corpse of the roc just calmly watching them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">Now how am I going to do this, I don&apos;t want to give away the fact that I can shape shift or change my size, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey wondered watching the guards look between each other. She had already started infecting the rest of the insides of the roc. She had reached the point where movement could be seen beneath the skin causing the ponies to retreat a few steps. </text:span>OK, times up, dissolved into &apos;blood&apos; will have to do, <text:span text:style-name="T83">she decided and had the biomass within the body convert into a semi-liquid state. A thick red ooze started leaking from the bottom of the body making a pool around it. The pool never extended more than a meter beyond the edge of the body despite it deflating like a balloon. It took a long time, but eventually the entire body was converted and the biomass hidden underground. All that was left was a cat that had not moved during the whole thing and the quartet of guards that stood slack jawed as they were transfixed by the disturbing sight.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">Yes, I thought my performance was stunning too, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey mused while walking back into the forest, </text:span>I hate working with this liquid shit. Completely blind, and a pain to get it al moving the same direction. <text:span text:style-name="T83">Despite her complaints she did get the biomass soaked into the ground to follow her into the forest where she could reabsorb it. Once she finished drawing the liquid up from the ground into her body she stood as tall as full sized horse even though she had compressed the biomass. The ground actually shook from each of her steps and she had to modify herself to resemble a tiger to compensate for the size. She did not make for a stealthy figure and one of the guard ponies had found her. He did not stick around for long when she looked straight at him. </text:span>Of course they just had to follow me, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey rolled her eyes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">Picking a spot Audrey settled in for the night, no predator could or would bother her at this size. She <text:soft-page-break/>had plenty of thinking to do, for one thing the genome of the pony she saved did not match with any of the other ponies. Despite looking like one she was not a pony. Audrey was more interested in the wealth of information she got from the roc and set about assimilating the memories. Species problems could wait.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P61"><text:span text:style-name="T500">Audrey had only expected to gain knowledge of the surrounding area, and animal patterns from the roc. Along with that she also received a mental dictionary of the local language. The animals here were much smarter than on Earth and could actually understand speech to a degree. That was more than enough for Audrey though as she used the new knowledge to review her memories of the day to try understanding what the ponies had been saying. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T68">Well, I think I have found every single way to say &apos;Oh look a kitty&apos; in this language, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T311">she grumbled before reaching one of the earlier memories. A bright pink mare that had been in the carriage babbled near constantly, but a couple sentences in particular concerned Audrey.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P61"><text:span text:style-name="T311">One of the first things the pink one had said was, “H</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T264">ello not-a-kitty, I&apos;m Pinkie Pie </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T311">and</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T264"> I hope you liked </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T311">Luna&apos;s and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T264">your welcome </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T311">to Ponyville</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T264"> party.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P71" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 2</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">Alright, that roc had a mate that will likely show up in Ponyville today, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey wondered as she stared at the canopy above her, </text:span>do I want to get involved, it would only eat a couple of them. Maybe the ponies will put up a good defense this time... or it might get that nice pony from yesterday, I like that one. <text:span text:style-name="T83">She had finished reviewing all the new information last night and had been debating with herself until the sun rose. </text:span>The whole town was pretty nice too, I doubt they will handle ponies being eaten any better than Manhattan handled the Blacklight outbreak, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey realized, </text:span>It would get lonely without someone around, and I don&apos;t have anything better to do. <text:span text:style-name="T83">“Better watch out monsters, this towns mine.” Audrey grinned as she got up and thudded her way to the edge of Ponyville.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">Between the forest and Ponyville was a stretch of empty land. Only some hills and stream running just outside the trees disrupted the plains that made up this no mans land. Audrey decided this was the perfect place to wander through while waiting for the roc to show up. Given her size and the foot prints <text:s/>she left behind it was not long before a squad of those guard ponies were flying after her. They had started trying to scare her away. One of them even landed with flared wings and started shouting for her to go away. “You need a deeper voice to scare away wild animals.” Audrey said to the guard on the ground.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">The other three guards landed as she all stared silently at Audrey who was content to stare back. “Did it just critique our attempts to scare it away?” one of the ponies asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">“Yes.” Audrey replied and sat down.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">“Regardless you need to leave this area.” another guard said and drew his sword, “We will use force if necessary.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">“But I&apos;m just taking a little walk.” Audrey said, “You have bigger concerns, anyway. Did you know <text:soft-page-break/>that rocs are usually found in pairs?” That comment killed any rebuttal as the implication sunk in. One of the guards had fallen to his haunches and was pointing to the sky with wide eyes and gaping mouth. Audrey looked in the direction he was pointing and smiled, “Ah, here she comes. You guys can have the first round since you can fly.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">The ponies took off immediately, but they sure did not fly fast toward the giant bird. Audrey figured now was as good a time as any to make her challenge and took in a deep breath. She let loose with a lion&apos;s roar but several times louder since no one else was nearby. Any ponies that were unaware of the incoming fight now knew something was happening. With any luck they would go back inside until the roc left. More important was the fact that the roc had heard and was now heading straight for Audrey with a quartet of golden dots trying to harass it. The roc may not have the agility to catch any of the pegasi, but the pegasi did not have anything that could pierce its thick hide either.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">The stalemate lasted until the roc swooped down to try catching Audrey. Audrey was still seated but had lifted her forelegs up in an imitation of a wrestling pose. To everyones surprise but Audrey herself she did catch the roc and threw it back the way it came. It had been a nearly dead stop for the roc so it was too dazed to recover before landing on its back a few meters away. Audrey retracted the tendrils she had burrowed into the ground as anchors and stood back up. The scrambled to right itself but stumbled a few times before getting back to its feet. “You not leaving fast enough, this is my town. Now get out.” Audrey growled to the roc causing it to speed up its retreat before flying off.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">“No, this is not your town.” the same guard that threatened her before said as the squad landed to surrounding Audrey. “Now, you will leave or we will be forced to act.” he continued when the four had pointed their swords at Audrey.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">Audrey chuckled, “You really think you can? I don&apos;t know what the problem is, I mainly just made the claim to keep other creatures.” she walked forward and grabbed the guards sword and pushed it into her chest. Instead of piercing through the blade began bending as she said, “Do you really want to fight me? We don&apos;t really have a conflict right now, so why create one?” After that she walked back into the forest to get started on her next task. Making a pony persona and establishing a base since she had way too much mass for a pony. The guard threw his bent sword on the ground and stomped off with the others following behind him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">I could store this mass underground, but it would just be dead weight then, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey pondered as she went deeper into the forest, </text:span>If I want to keep monsters away, then I need sentries... hmm, oak trees would work.<text:span text:style-name="T83"> She went up to one of the trees at random and poked her claws into it to try infecting the tree. When that did not work she tried a different vector and spit a stream of liquid biomass at the base of the tree. Once it soaked in she could try attacking the roots of the tree. It still took longer than with animals, but she was able to infect the tree. A black line starting at the base swept over the entire plant, but left it looking exactly the same. In reality the tree was now part of Audrey&apos;s body as much as the cat standing nearby.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">Excellent, I can become to forest, and use photosynthesis. I&apos;ll never have to starve again, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey grinned as she transferred mass from her cat form to the tree so she could turn into a pony that will not </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T83">crack the roads under her hooves. Mixing all of the samples from ponies that she got yesterday, she turned herself into a pony for the first time. Using her tree to get a look at her new pony body caused her to frown. Her new body was about half the size of the other ponies, but it had a black coat, red mane, and gray eyes. </text:span>Yeah, I am not going to be some kind of demon pony, <text:span text:style-name="T83">she thought, </text:span>the gray eyes can stay I guess.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The first change she made was to lengthened her mane and turn it brown to match her original appearance. Letting it fall to the left of the neck she had it separate into three tendrils and braid itself together. The end of the braid ended just past her knees, but looked odd without a tie holding it in place. She let the end turn black again and squeezed it together to the end making it look like a brush. She did the same to her tail before moving on to her coat. <text:span text:style-name="T13">I wonder if I can infuse hair with chlorophyll..., </text:span>she thought before her coat slowly turned green starting from her back. She stopped before it fully changed and decided to leave it where her coat faded to black at the bottom half of her legs.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">Now, why am I so tiny. I know I got the age right, so do ponies just age differently, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey wondered as she made her way to out of the forest, </text:span>whatever, I can be a child, still need a name. All the ponies the roc knew of had names of some adjective, noun pair. <text:span text:style-name="T83">Thinking back on what she saw in Ponyville she realized, </text:span>I&apos;m not even on Earth, why are the ponies using ancient Greek designs?! I guess I might as well go with the flow and just go along with the &apos;Athena&apos; name Blackwatch gave me. <text:span text:style-name="T83">Looking at one of her hooves she came up with a name for her new body: Blackened Aegis. </text:span>I should probably be less willing to use the name they gave me, but I also get the initials B.A. so I&apos;ll live.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Before leaving the forest she had given her tree the ability to hear and use sonar so she could be aware of its surroundings. Then she had it expand its root network and begin infecting other plants in the direction of Ponyville. In just a few hours she would take over of the edge of the forest facing Ponyville and be able to sense anything trying to cross through. Now, she just needed to figure out how to get past the patrolling guards that had shown up.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Waiting for the nearest guard to pass her hiding spot in a bush before rattling it. The guard naturally heard and came to investigate. He crept closer to bush before Aegis hissed, “No, go away, I&apos;m being sneaky.” The squeaky childlike voice and obvious eyes peering out of the bush relaxed the guard and caused him to put away his sword.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">“You shouldn&apos;t be out here, little filly.” the guard said, “Now come on out of there.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Aegis crawled out of the bush and said, “You&apos;re making it hard to be sneaky.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">“It&apos;s too dangerous to be out here, there are monsters wandering about.” he said trying to hide a smile behind a stern face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">“Duh, what do you think I was trying to sneak up on.” she replied</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">“Alright, where are your parents?” he sighed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“I don&apos;t need par...” she got out before swallowing the rest of the word. As she spoke the sounds of </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T83">an inferno were heard behind her increasing in intensity with each word. She could even feel the oppressive heat on her back. Her voice had hitched and eyes widen as the phantom sensations faded away. </text:span>Why did that almost trigger my geas?<text:span text:style-name="T83"> she thought while taking a deep breath.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">“Are you alright?” the guard asked with a frown.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“Yeah, Yeah I&apos;m fine. I just don&apos;t have parents.” she whispered with eyes unfocused. Some of the trees she was trying to consume had also fallen when the hallucination came and she was trying to put them back in place. The guard was eager to end this conversation and simply picked her up and carried her to Ponyville on his back. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T312">He went up to a building still in view of the forest and knocked on the door. Aegis tried to read the sign to get a clue of what he was up to before remembering that the roc she got her information from did not read or write.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38">Wow, just the pony I was looking for, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Aegis thought when a yellow unicorn with teal mane opened the door. Aegis mouthed, “play along, please?” to the unicorn after getting her attention.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26">“Hello sir, and what has she done now?” the unicorn sighed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26">“Ma&apos;am, I caught her trying to sneak into the Everfree forest. Please try to keep better track of her, there are monsters around.” the guard said. A short discussion later and Aegis was inside the building and the guard was headed back to his post.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26">“He is right about the monsters, but who are you and why are you here?” the unicorn mare asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“Blackened Aegis, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T313">and I, uh, don&apos;t really know what building this is.” Aegis replied.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">“I&apos;m Citrine, and this is the Rose Garden, Ponyville&apos;s children&apos;s home.” Citrine said, “It would be better if I brought you to the matron, Rose Garden.” The pair entered into an office just to the side of the entrance. Inside was single desk and assortment of pictures of the residents on the wall with a few certificates mixed in. Behind the desk was the tallest Earth pony Aegis had seen. She had a green coat and rosy mane along with some slight wrinkles on her face as she smiled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">“Oh Citrine, and who is this with you?” the mare asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:span text:style-name="T313">“This is Blackened Aegis, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T314">one of the new guards brought her.” Citrine explained as Rose came around to the front of the desk. Aegis reached out and put a hoof on one of Rose&apos;s forelegs earning her some strange looks.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">“What species are you?” Aegis asked making the two mares freeze up.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">“What?” Rose asked before squinting at Aegis. Rose even used a hoof to lift Aegis&apos; head to get a better look. “I could ask you the same, if you were a pony you would be in a coma from lack of mana.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">“Mana? What&apos;s that?” Aegis questioned with a tileted head.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">“Magical energy.” Rose answered but Aegis still had a blank look, “Citrine, would you demonstrate please?” Rose said and Citrine&apos;s horn gained a pink corona along with the quill on the desk. The quill then floated over to Aegis who stared at it in wonder.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28"><text:soft-page-break/>“Whoa, how are you doing that?” Aegis gasped and even gave a little hop. The quill levitated back into place and lost its corona.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:span text:style-name="T314">“You&apos;ve... never seen magic before?” Citrine asked </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T315">and got a no from Aegis, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T316">Where did you come from?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">“I was summoned to the Everfree forest. Since there were no ponies on the world I lived in I assume this is a different one.” Aegis replied. That response took a while to process for the ponies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">“Are you a shape shifter, or were you transformed?” Rose asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">“Shape shifter. You&apos;re just going to believe that claim?” Aegis replied.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:span text:style-name="T316">“Yes, it&apos;s too absurd to use as a lie, and those gray eyes of yours mean something is amiss. It&apos;s as good as anything else I could come up with.” Rose replied. Citrine quietly left the office and locked the door before Rose continued, “The species I know of that disguise as ponies, do so </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T317">because they intend to prey on them.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30">“Wow, that&apos;s a loaded sentence.” Aegis chuckled, “I&apos;m here out of curiosity. I am fully cable of eating a pony, but its easier for me to just grow leaves and stand in the sun. That&apos;s why coat is green.” She turned to the side to show off her coat of fur. “That does leave the question of what you are doing. Is this going to turn into a fight? I would rather not, but I already fought off two rocs, so...” She stated after steeling her expression.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30">“Wait, you were that crazy cat yesterday?” Rose gasped.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30">“Yes, I suppose it did look crazy, but I didn&apos;t want it to take Citrine.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30">“Why?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30">“Because... I... don&apos;t know.” Aegis answered with a scrunched muzzle and furrowed brow.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">Rose laid down to get to the same level as Aegis and said, “You&apos;ve been through a lot haven&apos;t you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">Aegis had to lock her legs to avoid falling over. She sighed, “Every thing&apos;s gone. The city I lived in was eaten, our leaders abandoned us, my parents, my sanity are all gone. Even my name doesn&apos;t feel right anymore.” Tears were welling in her eyes as she continued to speak, “I tried to remake myself, but I don&apos;t think I got it right.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T318">You just need guidance.” Rose whispered as she scooped up Aegis, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T319">My home was destroyed too, but I had Citrine there with me. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T320">You</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T321">&apos;ve gone through more than I can imagine, but I know that I would have been lost with Citrine.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T318">Aegis let herself be drawn into a hug thinking, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">I </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T71">guess I have been adrift, survival was all I focused on</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T69">. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T318">Soon they separated and Rose asked, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T322">Where are you living by the way</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T318">?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:span text:style-name="T318">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T322">The Everfree forest.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P32">“Thats a bit dangerous for a filly.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63">“<text:span text:style-name="T501">I was an adult, I was 19 years old. I don&apos;t know if I messed up this body, or ponies age differently. Either way my mind was transferred to a weapon intended to destroy cities, a forest can&apos;t beat me.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T501">You got the age right, 19 is still prepubescent for ponies, but for the love of the Earth Mother why would anypony create something capable of destroying a city.” Rose said before her eyes widened as she gasped, “That&apos;s what happened isn&apos;t it, it was used on your home.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">Aegis looked at the floor with ears folded down as she said, “Yes, it&apos;s a disease completely deadly. The part of the city I lived in and the outbreak happened was on an island. We were locked away immediately, but still over a million were dead or dying within a week.” She looked back up with a neutral expression and continued, “It&apos;s a unique disease, it remakes everything it infects and becomes symbiotic. Only one other person made it through the process, though I wouldn&apos;t call it surviving so much as being reborn. There&apos;s a sort of hive mind thing connecting it all together, but my mind was used to create a separate one giving me full control over the disease itself.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“You&apos;re a gestalt!” Rose blurted. Seeing Aegis&apos; confusion she added, “Your a collective of other creatures.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“Oh, yes, tiny single... unit creatures.” Aegis said, “Also means I am immune to swords and spears. Maybe those guards will figure that out and go away.” She had been monitoring her conversion of the forest and some of the guards had seen the black lines sweeping over the trees. They had to investigate and start following her from tree to tree.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“Why are the royal guards after you?” Rose sighed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“I don&apos;t know, they didn&apos;t like when I was waiting for the second roc. <text:span text:style-name="T502">I demonstrated some of my strength and intent to protect my territory.” Aegis said, “Why would they keep poking around like they are? The roc knew to fly away.” Rose was rubbing her forehead by that point.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“<text:span text:style-name="T502">They&apos;re not wild animals, that will just make them come in larger numbers.” Rose groaned, “What do you mean </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T503">second</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T502"> roc?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“<text:span text:style-name="T502">Roc&apos;s come in pairs. I ate the first one, and scared off the other one to let her know that Ponyville is mine. I, uh, have no idea what to do with the royal guards though. They seem to be increasing in number.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“<text:span text:style-name="T502">Well, they don&apos;t know where you are, so just avoid them until the go away. Where did you learn about rocs?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“<text:span text:style-name="T502">I absorb memories from whatever I eat as well as the... hmm, life pattern... I don&apos;t know the word, I learned Equish from the roc. Also, I can split my body into separate pieces. This body is just a small piece.” One of the guards had started to poking at one of the trees that Aegis had converted. Another guard waved him away and cast a spell at the tree. Aegis eyes widened and she yelped, “They used a fire ball.” As a reflex the tree hit by the fire retracted underground leaving a rough hole in the ground.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“<text:span text:style-name="T502">The guards did?” Rose asked, but Aegis was only half paying attention. The hole began to fill with a red liquid as the guards watched. “Aegis what are you up to?” Rose asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“<text:span text:style-name="T502">I don&apos;t like fire.” Aegis whispered with unfocused eyes. A tendril shot out of the pit and straight toward the guard that waved away the first. It impacted the guards foreleg and its barbed tip sunk in. As </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T502">the tendril began retracting the guard began to scream before more tendrils rose out of the ground. Another of the guards chopped the tendril off letting the wounded one retreat.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">“<text:span text:style-name="T504">Aegis, what are you doing?” Rose demanded and grabbed the filly, but got no response. Aegis had refocused her attention on her human body formed in pit.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65">As the other tendrils shot towards the guard she lifted herself out with her arms. The tendril also impaled the guard, one even going straight through the armor, before dragging him forward despite his attempts to retreat. “I can&apos;t feel my leg!” the guard yelled staring in horror at the black veins spreading from the hole in his leg. The guard that was poking at the tree still tried to cut all of the tendrils, but the first one had already reformed. A couple of other guards tried to pull him back and did manage to slow the advance almost to a stop.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65">The other four guards present had lit their horns and were aiming at the creature that was now standing in front of the hole. “Well, what was so important you had to light me on fire for?” Athena demanded <text:span text:style-name="T505">to the unicorns, “You can stop trying to rescue him. He&apos;s already gone.” As she said that the pony being dragged into the pool stopped struggling and fell limp. The black veins appeared across his whole body, and he deformed into a writhing mass of tendrils. The other guards backed away as all the tendrils retracted into the ground and a new tree sprouted as a duplicate of the previous one. Only the guard&apos;s equipment remained. “A little warning, I hate fire.” Athena growled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65">“<text:span text:style-name="T505">Monster, you present a danger to Ponyville. We will strike you down.” One of the guards said, “do you have any last words?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65">“<text:span text:style-name="T506">You should be concerned with that roc, I think its going to Dodge Junction next.” Athena said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65">“<text:span text:style-name="T506">I&apos;ll take that under advisement. Colts, burn her down.” the leader of the guards said. The seven remaining guards all let lose the spells they had been charging and incinerated the woman. “That&apos;s one less threat--” he got out before a tendril from below pierced his stomach. Soon there were seven more sets of armor lying on the ground.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">When she returned to her Blackened Aegis form she opened her eyes to see a pink flame. She tried to scoot back from it before she realized the blaze was on Rose&apos;s hoof. Reversing direction she attempted to blow it out, but was met with no success. The flame died on its own as Rose sighed, “Well, I see that you returned to the land of the living. How big of a mess did you make?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">Aegis was staring at Rose&apos;s hoof as she answered, “It&apos;s just 8 sets of armor and weapons. Why was your hoof on fire, and how is it not burnt?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">“No, the mess is that you killed an entire squad.” Rose said with a frown.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">“But they lit me on fire. I&apos;m scared of fire, and it really hurts to have over 100 pounds of flesh vaporized. <text:span text:style-name="T507">They tried to kill me, the only difference is that I succeeded.</text:span>” Aegis asked <text:span text:style-name="T507">tail tucked between her legs.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">“<text:span text:style-name="T508">You really have forgotten how to live in society.” Rose said</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67">Aegis collapsed onto her belly and stammered, “<text:span text:style-name="T510">Yes, I couldn&apos;t afford civilized living, that would </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T510">have been a fast way to die</text:span>. Can you <text:span text:style-name="T510">teach</text:span> me?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67">“<text:span text:style-name="T509">Of course, that&apos;s part of why I created the Rose Garden.” Rose answered, “First I want you to Pinkie Promise to avoid killing anypony in the future.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68">An explanation of how to perform a Pinkie Promise later and the promise was made. Aegis&apos; hackles rose afterward as the leaves on all the trees she had converted rustled. She could feel a deep rumble shoot through her entire body as something settled into her very being. “There is no way that was a good omen.” Aegis said with wide eyes and ears pulled back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68">“What omen?” Rose asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68">“I could feel that promise settling in.” Aegis said, “What should I do about the other squad poking around? I don&apos;t think they are going to stop on their own.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68">“Well, you should inform them of the fate of their colleagues, but take no hostile action.” Rose said, “It will be a challenge, they will probably attack, but just run away then we can review. It&apos;s a bit harder than I would like for an initial lesson, but this will only get worse if left alone.” Aegis nodded and reformed her human body near the second squad. This time she decided to wear a white toga with a purple border thinking, <text:span text:style-name="T13">Maybe simpler clothing will make them less likely to use fire. I like the look at least.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">Standing in the open within ear shot of the squad Athena called out, “Hey, do you need any help?” The guards had been paying attention to the trees and drew their weapons out of reflex as they turned to Athena. <text:span text:style-name="T13">Just channel my inner Wal-mart helper that should be easy enough, </text:span>Athena thought as she put on a friendly smile, <text:span text:style-name="T13">At least I only have to deal with levitating swords this time.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">“Halt creature, state your business here.” the <text:span text:style-name="T511">S</text:span>arge<text:span text:style-name="T511">a</text:span>nt in charge ordered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">“I&apos;m wondering what you are doing and if I can aid in any way.” Athena said before shifting her eyes away from the group, “Also, I have some information for you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">The leader narrowed his eyes before he said, “We are looking for a large feline monster that has been seen around here.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">“Oh, well you found me, now what?” Athena said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">“You are definitely not a cat, you look more like a monkey.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">“Ape technically, I don&apos;t have a tail. Though I can be a cat, I just like this form more.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">“<text:span text:style-name="T511">A shape shifter, great.” the pony mumbled before ordering one of the other guards to retrieve the lieutenant, “I don&apos;t suppose you could enlighten us about the moving black lines on the trees?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">“<text:span text:style-name="T512">That is the border between the natural trees and the ones I control.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">“<text:span text:style-name="T511">Are you serious?” the Sargeant said keeping watch of the trees at the corner of his eye. The rest of the guards started backing away from the tree line while trying to keep it and Athena in sight.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">“<text:span text:style-name="T511">Yep” Athena said and waved her arm at the stand of trees. As her hand passed in front of each tree a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T511">section in the middle turned pitch black. Waving it back the other way returned the trees to normal.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">“<text:span text:style-name="T511">Well fuck.” one of the guards said. Everyone remained silent as they waited for the lieutenant to arrive. Rose was updated on the progress by Aegis, and went back to paperwork while she waited for the result after unlocking the door to the office. Aegis just assumed the form of a small box like she would do back in Manhattan when trying to remain hidden. Rose was confused at first especially when Aegis started talking without changing form, but went along with it after an explanation.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">The lieutenant arrived with 7 other guards, three of them pegasi while the rest were unicorns. “Well this looks to be a quick mission. I&apos;ve already sent a runner to retrieve the last squad, they should be here soon.” the lieutenant said, “I hope you will surrender peacefully, but we are prepared to do this the hard way.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">“Oh, I have no intention of moving, but a peaceful resolution would be nice. Although, things are about to get... awkward.” Athena said, “The other squad tried to use fire, and well, I really do like fire... or being lit on fire... definitely dislike being incinerated. So they&apos;re all dead.” Silence was all she got from the ponies after that so she continued, “While I have your attention, Dodge Junction will likely be attacked by a roc today or tomorrow, depending on how injured it is.” Athena was tracking the runner as he flew along the tree line and looked up just before he impacted her. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">He had been flying in with sword in mouth ready to impale her when he struck. The sword sunk in all he way to the hilt running straight through her heart. “Shit, Should have kept the armored skin.” she coughed with blood running out the side of her mouth, <text:span text:style-name="T13">This shall make an excellent debut performance, maybe they will even do an autopsy. </text:span>Athena&apos;s legs began to shake as she frowned down at the sword. She tried to catch herself as she fell, but only succeeded in collapsing to the side instead of on her face. One final rasp and she lay still on the ground no longer drawing breath. <text:span text:style-name="T13">Just need to stop most metabolic processes so I can cool to room temperature and they will have one Trojan &apos;corpse&apos; to take home, </text:span>Athena thought, <text:span text:style-name="T13">your move lieutenant. Oh wait got to stop converting the forest, too.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">“Well, I think I&apos;m headed to autopsy now.” Aegis said when she popped out of her head out of her box startling Rose.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">“Oh, I forgot you were still there. So what happened, I take it you let them think they killed you?” Rose said causing Aegis to relay the recent events to her. “What is this about Dodge Junction?” Rose questioned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">“The rocs were coming here to find new hunting grounds. It&apos;s odd the one I ate was centuries old, but yesterday was the first time he even considered the possibility of using Equestria as a hunting ground. Whatever the reason, they wanted to set up a nest near the Everfree and Dodge Junction is the second closest &apos;pony nest&apos;. Ponyville is closer, but a larger creature has claimed that one.” Aegis explained.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">“Well, hopefully this is the last one <text:span text:style-name="T513">for a while.” Rose said leaning back, “Well this has been an eventful day and it&apos;s only lunch time. Do you like daisy&apos;s?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">“<text:span text:style-name="T513">I&apos;ve never eaten a daisy, but I have been eating garbage for the past year, just about anything is an </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T513">improvement.” Aegis said as the two finally exited the office, “The one who summoned me brought me here to fight other monsters, there&apos;s no way she only meant a pair of rocs.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P279" text:outline-level="1"><text:span text:style-name="T119">C</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">hapter 3</text:span></text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P276"><text:span text:style-name="T323">A</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">egis was introduced to the other foals at lunch, but they were more interested in the food at the time. There were 10 foals at the table three colts and the rest fillies. Most of the foals ran off when they were done eating. A couple of fillies and a colt were the only ones that stayed behind as Aegis finished eating. One of the fillies was an Earth pony with a red coat and blue mane with a light blue spiral. The other was pegasus with a sky blue coat and yellow unkempt mane. Neither of them had cutie marks. They introduced themselves as Ruby Swirl and Electric Breeze.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P276"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T324">How did you get your coat dyed like that?” Breeze asked gesturing to Aegis&apos; hooves.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P296">“I can change the color of my fur.” Aegis answered and lifted a hoof. She changed the fur to green to match the rest of her coat before returning it to black.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P296">“How can you do that without magic?” the colt said approaching the group. He was close enough in age to be confused for a stallion. He had a cerulean mane and gray coat with a blue circumscribed hexagram for a cutie mark in the center of it was an open eye.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P296">“Innate ability.” Aegis responded</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P296">“Earth ponies have magic too, Essy!” Ruby replied.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P296">“I know, but gray eyed ponies don&apos;t.” he said causing the fillies to look into Aegis&apos; eyes before turning back to him confused.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P276"><text:span text:style-name="T324">“It&apos;s not well known, but ponies get their color from magic. Which makes me wonder what your default colors are.” Essy said. Aegis grinned as she changed her form back to its original colors. The fillies recoiled but the colt said, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T325">Are you a demon?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278"><text:span text:style-name="T83">Aegis almost answered &apos;no&apos; but stopped when she thought about how demons were defined in Equestria. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">Huh, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T72">Equestria gets enough alien visitors to have a word for dangerous alien, or soulless monster</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">she observed, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T72">they&apos;re associated with the 7 deadly sins</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T72">Why the hell, are there so many</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13"> parallels with Earth.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83"> “Yes, I guess I do count as a gluttony demon of all things.” Aegis said as the rest of the children looked at Rose standing behind her, “Uh, Hello Rose.” Aegis quickly changed back to her normal colors.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P297">“I&apos;m getting the impression you are a glutton for awkward situation.” Rose sighed, “It&apos;s like you are incapable of keeping secrets.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P297">“Um, well, you see” Aegis said, “I can&apos;t. I got to test some experimental interrogation techniques that amount to a geas.” The fillies were lost until Aegis said, “Magically enforced rules, like &apos;you may not say anything thats untrue&apos;.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">Rose winced at that revelation and said, “That&apos;s going to be a problem.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T514">Maybe not as much as you think. Direct questions are a problem, but there are a lot of ambiguities and assumptions to exploit in casual conversation. Only false statements are banned, dishonest and misleading ones are completely fine.” Aegis said, “Also, maybe I can open other options. I could intimidate you enemies with spiders.” She pulled a large spider the size of hoof out of her mane and placed it on the table. Ruby shrieked, Breezy was fascinated with the creature, and Essy chuckled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T514">I&apos;ll take that into consideration.” Rose said watching the spider clean up Aegis&apos; plate, “for now I want all of you to avoid letting Ponyville know there&apos;s a new demon in town.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T515">If you&apos;re a gluttony demon, shouldn&apos;t you be fatter.” Ruby asked with a squint.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T515">This is just a small part of myself, my total mass is somewhere around 100 Kilotonnes. About the same as a large building.” Aegis said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T515">How did you manage to hide an entire building?” Rose asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T515">The easy way, in plain sight.” Aegis grinned, “It&apos;s pretty easy to hide a collection of trees in a forest.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T516">The royal guards were looking for something in the Everfree.” Essy said, “They came back with fewer guards and some kind of bag. Did you...”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T516">Yes, she did, Esoteric Tome. Which is why I got her to Pinkie promise not to do it again.” Rose said cutting off the end of that statement. After hearing the words &apos;Pinkie promise&apos; all of the ponies visibly relaxed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T516">I get the feeling I&apos;m missing something.” Aegis said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T516">Nobody breaks a Pinkie promise, its the fastest way to lose a friend.” Ruby said before a pink mare popped out of the nearby flower pot and shouted &apos;Forever&apos;.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T516">What was that?” Aegis asked inspecting the pot just after the mare left.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T516">That&apos;s just Pinkie.” said all of the other ponies together.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T517">I get the feeling I&apos;m not the strangest thing in Ponyville.” Aegis said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T517">Hey, where did Breezy go.” Ruby asked noticing that her friend had wandered off during the conversation. Breezy came back into the dining room when she heard her name followed by the spider.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T517">Well, that was gross.” Breezy said watching the spider climb back into Aegis&apos; mane, “All of the trash is gone though.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T517">You can eat normal foods, you don&apos;t need to eat the trash.” Rose told Aegis.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T517">But, it would just go to a landfill otherwise.” Aegis said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P278">“<text:span text:style-name="T517">Does this mean we don&apos;t have to take out the trash anymore?” Ruby asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P277">“<text:span text:style-name="T517">Can it?” Aegis asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P277">“<text:span text:style-name="T517">I don&apos;t think Ponyville&apos;s ever going to return to normal.” Tome laughed. Rose relented to the odd </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T517">request and shooed the children outside before they could drive her insane. They ponies split up into pairs and went their separate ways for the day. When she heard that the princess personal student was the new librarian she had to go with Esoteric Tome&apos;s plan. She had finally gotten his full name when Breezy was complaining about Aegis&apos; being another egghead.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">The two ponies passed through a small shower near one of the restaurants in Ponyville. At one of the <text:s/>tables was a purple unicorn and dragon. The unicorn was dragged off by another white unicorn before Aegis could hear much, but she did notice the soggy sandwich and hear the words &apos;gala ticket&apos;. “Who was that?” she asked Tome.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“That was the new librarian.” Tome said, “Guess she was having lunch.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“She&apos;ll need a new sandwich.” Aegis said as she walked up and grabbed the ruined lunch. She shoved the mess in her mouth and swallowed it whole before pulling a pristine sandwich out of her mane.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“I don&apos;t think I want to know how you did that.” Tome said cringing away from the scene, “What are you planning to do with that?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“I&apos;m an adorable and proactive filly bearing a gift for a hungry unicorn.” Aegis said putting on a cherubic smile. Tome was unmoved and just quirked an eyebrow. “And a survivalist that wants to hide inside high profile targets as a symbiote.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“Alright, that is incredibly creepy.” Tome said and Aegis just shrugged, “That&apos;s not going to hurt her is it?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“No, that would defeat the purpose of hiding. At most she might notice that she gets sick less. Depending on political machination she might also benefit from toxin immunity.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“Seriously?! That&apos;s amazing.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“Yeah, I can eat all kinds of things including many toxic and hazardous substances. I can just eat anything that gets inside her that&apos;s not supposed to be there.” Aegis said before grinning, “You have a crush on her don&apos;t you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“What, no.” Tome blurted out. The blush suggested otherwise as Aegis trotted off after her quarry. <text:span text:style-name="T518">They found the purple mare just leaving a carousel themed building and Aegis ran off after her with the sandwich in her hoof.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“<text:span text:style-name="T518">Hello, miss library lady.” Aegis chirped, “I saw your sandwich get all soggy, so I made you another one.” She sat on her haunches and offered the food item with both hooves. The mare was taken aback, but quickly shifted to a stern expression.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P313">“<text:span text:style-name="T518">You weren&apos;t put up to this were you?” she asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P314">Perfect, some threat of tears and she would have to be heartless to not eat it, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Aegis thought while keeping a slight frown, “No” she whined, “I thought you might still be hungry.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P314"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“I&apos;m sorry,” the mare </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T326">apologized instantly, “Thank you for the sandwich, I&apos;ve just had a very strange </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T326">day.” she took the sandwich from the filly.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P315">And for the finishing move, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Aegis said, “Aren&apos;t you going to eat it?” She had the most hopeful expression she could manage, </text:span>Heh, children have evil powers. Good thing most of them don&apos;t know it. <text:span text:style-name="T83">The unicorn was helpless against the assault and took a bite. The rest of the sandwich followed shortly, Aegis had used her abilities to make the sandwich more flavorful than it otherwise would be. She moved herself through the stomach lining and disguised her cells as clones of the mares normal white blood cells. Using small plaque buildup and other minor errant growths Aegis had matched the presence of the unicorns immune system without being noticed. </text:span>This mare must love her cheeseburgers<text:span text:style-name="T83">, Aegis thought as she hugged the unicorn and returned to Tome.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P315"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“Pure evil wielding innocence like that. Are you a supervillain?” Tome asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P315"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“I like to think I am just pragmatic.” Aegis said, “Although, I have the memories of several hundred mad biologists. It may have influenced me a little.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P307">“You could give someone whiplash going from innocent to a statement like that so fast.” Tome said watching the librarian head off somewhere, “What made you think I have a crush?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P307">“Aside from the ogling,” Aegis deadpanned causing Tome to blush, “I&apos;ve refined my hearing to the point I can hear your heartbeat from here. I may have forgotten how to function in society, but I stay alert just to survive. I like to keep tabs on everything, like the pony that has been following us since we left.” Tome looked around wildly at that trying to figure out who was following them. “You don&apos;t need to worry its probably just Citrine, <text:span text:style-name="T519">she&apos;s about the right size and body structure.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P308">To her surprise it was a beige unicorn mare with brown hair that joined the pair after hearing Aegis. Aegis had some of her tail burrow under the ground as she said, “Oh, hello, was there something you wanted?” The sail hairs raised out of the ground and gently pushed into the unicorns hoof. After a quick check Aegis learned that this unicorn was Citrine despite the new appearance. “Are you a shapeshifter?” Aegis asked in a whisper.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P308">“How did you pierce through my disguise so easily?” Citrine asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P308">“I don&apos;t rely on sight.” Aegis answered, “I use hearing as my primary sense and even figured out how to use sonar. Makes it very hard to sneak up on me. Oh, and your genome didn&apos;t change.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P308">“Don&apos;t tell me that you can hear DNA or something.” Tome said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P308">“No, but I can manipulate and store it better than any laboratory. I still have to have physical contact to get a sample.” Aegis said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P308">“But you didn&apos;t contact me.” Citrine wondered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P308">“Check under your front left hoof.” Aegis said causing Citrine to lift her hoof and see the hairs. She decided to move a step to the right before returning all four hooves to the ground.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P308">“Your like some kind of super spy.” Tome said watching the hairs be pulled back into place with wide eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P277"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T519">I&apos;m sorry spying on you, but we wanted to see how you act when not being watched.” Citrine apologized, “I guess that&apos;s not really going to work.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P277">“<text:span text:style-name="T519">You don&apos;t need to apologize. I actually find it comfortingly familiar.” Aegis said, “Although, there&apos;s not much to see. I&apos;m not complicated, just broken.” The others frowned at that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P277">“<text:span text:style-name="T520">Well, I also wanted to thank you for saving me yesterday.” Citrine smiled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">Aegis blinked at that before saying, “Your... welcome?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">“Why do you find that so confusing?” Citrine continued.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">“Nobody&apos;s ever thanked me before. If they knew that I was the one to help, they would have tried to kill me.” Aegis said, “It&apos;s understandable, the city was basically being eaten by the same thing that I have become.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">“Why did you save me then?” Citrine asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">“I didn&apos;t want you to be eaten by the roc.” Aegis said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">“Ah, but why did you want that? You weren&apos;t hoping for a reward.” Citrine countered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">“I... Um“ Aegis said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">“You don&apos;t know, <text:span text:style-name="T521">do you?” Citrine smiled, “You did it for love.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">“<text:span text:style-name="T521">What?” Aegis asked Citrine with her head tilted to the right.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">“<text:span text:style-name="T521">She is a changeling, she would know.” Tome said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P316">“<text:span text:style-name="T521">Huh?” Aegis said tilting to the left now. &apos;</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T72">A terrifying creature that eats love and replaces loved ones.&apos; Sounds like the standard bogeyman type of myth, I&apos;ll sort that out later, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T327">Aegis thought and stared at her chest</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T72">. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T327">“I still have... love left?” Aegis asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P309">“<text:span text:style-name="T521">Yes, just a spark, but it&apos;s definitely there.” Citrine said, “It is odd though, I couldn&apos;t even sense anything from you yesterday.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P309">“<text:span text:style-name="T521">How do you find love so confusing?” Tome asked. Citrine&apos;s ears shot up and she held her breath.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P309">“<text:span text:style-name="T522">You don&apos;t want to know the full answer, but having some kind of invulnerable nervous system has its downsides. Third degree burns are supposed to be numb, but I have become very familiar with fourth degree ones.” Aegis said, “Most people don&apos;t even know about those, they are very easy to survive.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P310">Citrine grabbed Aegis and started petting her while saying, “<text:span text:style-name="T523">I&apos;m sorry you had to go through that. That&apos;s why you react so strongly to fire, isn&apos;t it?” she cooed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P310">“<text:span text:style-name="T523">Yeah, but don&apos;t worry. I got used to the pain so its only a minor distraction now.” Aegis said enjoying the attention.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P310">“<text:span text:style-name="T523">That&apos;s not a good thing.” Citrine said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P310"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T523">It&apos;s not?” Aegis replied.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P310">“<text:span text:style-name="T523">No” Citrine reaffirmed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P310">“<text:span text:style-name="T523">You said you can manipulate genes. I don&apos;t know if you can use it, but changelings are fireproof.” Tome said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P310">“<text:span text:style-name="T523">That might work.” Aegis said trying to figure out what to do if that ability required magic. During that time she got the odd sensation of moving out of 3D space before moving back into it. “That felt weird. I think I just felt that librarian move through some other dimension. Can unicorns do that?” Aegis said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P310">“<text:span text:style-name="T523">Probably a teleportation spell. I would be more surprised if Twilight Sparkle Protégé of Princess Celestia couldn&apos;t do it.” Tome said, “Although, I&apos;ve never heard of anypony actually feeling the movement, just disorientation from the sudden change of perspective.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_1" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 4</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P252">That night Wild was awoken by an itch. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T429">Something was actually damaging her and that would have to be rectified</text:span>. <text:s/>She located the source as one of her trees along the border of the forest. <text:s/>There was a pony sized creature by that tree so she silently remade her human body in the top of one of the trees. <text:s/>When she opened her eyes she discovered that it was not a pony, but instead a deer that was messing with the tree. <text:s/>The deer had the same build as a pony, but its tail was just a little cotton ball, and it did not have a mane. <text:s/>The deers coat was brown with white freckles that changed to white on the belly. <text:s/>It had a small barrel on its chest with some kind of liquid in it that it was currently pouring on the tree. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">Damn, it must be some kind of magic, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey thought watching as the liquid bubbled and steamed on the wood, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">I need a better way to handle that. <text:s/>All I can do now is repair the damage.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">Audrey continued watching the deer&apos;s attempts. <text:s/>The liquid was not causing too much damage but she wanted to figure out how it worked. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">No way is that targeted at Blacklight so it must just fix any &apos;damage&apos;. <text:s/>What if I use the generic biomass. <text:s/></text:span>The area treated by the liquid quickly turned black and stopped sizzling. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">Well, its nice that it worked, but biomass takes so much more energy. </text:span>She jumped down, squatted next to the deer and asked, “Whatcha doing?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“Who are you?” the deer asked and jumped to her hooves.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“Audrey. <text:s/>What is this stuff?” <text:s/>Audrey replied as she ran a finger along the blackened area of the tree. <text:s/>Now her finger was sizzling while she inspected it. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">Yep, it is some kind of broad spectrum healing magic, </text:span>she confirmed as her finger also turned black and stopped sizzling.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“You&apos;re that monster the ponies were talking about!” <text:s/>the deer accused</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“They&apos;re talking about me? <text:s/>Don&apos;t I feel special now.” Audrey said as she turned her attention to the pony trying to sneak up behind her. <text:s/>One of the guards was creeping toward her keeping out of sight and silent. <text:s/>A pretty good effort for most targets, but pointless against sonar. <text:s/>“That does not explain what you were doing?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173"><text:soft-page-break/>“I&apos;m here to remove your taint from this forest.” <text:s/>the deer declared.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“Doesn&apos;t look like your doing a good job of that.” <text:s/>Audrey said while poking at the blackened section of tree. <text:s/>The guard was within melee <text:span text:style-name="T448">range</text:span> now, and started reaching for his weapon. <text:s/>“You don&apos;t need to bother with that, <text:span text:style-name="T431">swords</text:span> can&apos;t actually hurt me.” <text:s/>Audrey called out to the guard. <text:s/>Instead of stopping the guard tried to draw his weapon and stab her as fast as possible. <text:s/>Audrey just jumped over the weapon and landed sitting on the guards back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“I will see you evil plan thwarted.” <text:s/>the deer said with a glare and opened her neck barrel to attempt to heal other parts of the forest. <text:s/>Audrey rolled her eyes and turned all of the trees within a few meters to biomass. <text:s/>They still held the same shape but were now black including the leaves make the forest dark even with the morning sun rising on the horizon.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“No you won&apos;t. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T430">T</text:span>here <text:span text:style-name="T430">is no plan here let alone an evil one.</text:span> <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T430">Even if there was one you couldn&apos;t stop me</text:span>.” <text:s/>Audrey said as she dismounted and walked forward to the doe. <text:s/>Audrey stared down at the doe as she reached out to grab the barrel and remove it. <text:s/>She looked at the thing in one hand while the other kept the deer back. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">What am I going to do with this thing?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“Give that back.” <text:s/>the doe shouted. <text:s/>Locating a distant bush near a tree she threw the barrel into it. <text:s/>The doe speed off as son as it touched the ground. <text:s/>Audrey was faster though as her tendrils were ready by the time the barrel arrived to draw it underground.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P173">“Now, what are you doing here?” <text:s/>Audrey said to the pony trying to sneak away. <text:s/>She pointed to the sword laying on the ground and said, “Also, you forgot something.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">She watched the pony freeze for a second before puffing himself up and marching over to the sword. <text:s text:c="3"/>“The royal guard has been dispatched to get rid of the monsters that have been plaguing this town recently.” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T430">he said levitating his sword at Audrey, “Surrender or we will use force.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T430">I&apos;m going to guess that you are a fresh recruit. <text:s/>You&apos;re going to need more than a sword to force me to do anything.” <text:s/>Audrey said and started walking to the camp. <text:s/>The guard&apos;s face turned red as he was forced to follow behind her. <text:s/>She caught the attention of the few guards awake this early in morning. <text:s/>They watched the odd pair go walk between the tents and arrive at the largest one. <text:s/>There were a couple guards at the entrance armed with spears. <text:s/>As Audrey walked up to them they pointed there spears at her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T431">Halt creature, you may not enter this tent.” <text:s/>The guard on the left said while holding his ground.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P174">“<text:span text:style-name="T431">Really, but I have a complaint to submit,” <text:s/>she said before turning around and lifting the guard behind her and presenting him to the other two. <text:s/>“This little guy is rude and kind of annoying.” <text:s/>The levitating sword was thrust in Audrey&apos;s back as the guard she was holding up exploded into a stream of expletives. <text:s/>Looking at the tip of the sword nearly poking into the ponies back she said, <text:s/>“I told you swords can&apos;t hurt me, but you didn&apos;t listen and now you&apos;ve gone and almost stabbed yourself.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P175">She placed the guard to the side as the tent guards stared in horror at the sword embedded in her abdomen. <text:s/>Seeing that they were distracted Audrey just moved the spears out of the way and walked in. <text:s/><text:soft-page-break/>It took the guards a moment to regain themselves, but she was already inside by then. <text:s/>Inside the tent was a single table with an annotated map of the Everfree forest on it. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T432">Behind that was a gray unicorn stallion with a brown mane. <text:s/>He was large even for the guards and even had a few scars making him an imposing figure for a pony. <text:s/>“As you may be aware, one of your ponies decided to visit and raised an interesting issue. <text:s/>I have already established myself in the nearby forest, and it seems that may be incompatible with your goals. <text:s/>So let&apos;s go ahead and just resolve this now instead of drawing it out.” <text:s/>Audrey said after sitting down opposite of the stallion.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P175">“<text:span text:style-name="T433">You just decided to barge in here like you own the place, and your goal is diplomacy?” <text:s/>the stallion deadpanned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P175">“<text:span text:style-name="T434">Yes.” <text:s/>Audrey said but the stallion was unmoved. <text:s/>She shifted her eyes to a empty patch of the tent and said, “Well, I&apos;m only 19. <text:s/>What do you expect?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P176">The stallion rubbed his temples at that and said, “Great. <text:s/>Well, we are going to relocate all of the dangerous creatures, and that includes you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P176">“<text:span text:style-name="T435">Oh, I want to see how you relocate a roc.” <text:s/>Audrey said before asking, “Why don&apos;t you have any pegasi though?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P176">“<text:span text:style-name="T435">Unicorns are perfectly capable of shooting flying targets.” <text:s/>the stallion grumbled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P176">“<text:span text:style-name="T435">Well, I&apos;m going to tell you now. <text:s/>You are not capable of relocating me. <text:s/>It&apos;s not like I intend to threaten the town either, so I don&apos;t know why you need me to move in the first place.” <text:s/>Audrey said as she got up and left the tent. <text:s/>Outside she found that a circle of guards surrounded the tent each with a glowing horn. <text:s/>“You actually used this opportunity. <text:s/>I&apos;m a little surprised actually, so what happens now?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P176">“<text:span text:style-name="T436">Now, you surrender and we send somewhere far away.” <text:s/>the leader said as he came out of the tent as well.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P176">“<text:span text:style-name="T436">Nah, I&apos;m not much of a fighter, but I think I try my luck with resisting.” <text:s/>Audrey said as she grabbed the sword impaling her by the blade and pulled it out. <text:s/>A small waterfall of blood fell out <text:s/>the now gaping hole in her side as she said, “I may have forgotten to mention, I&apos;ve might be a little insane. <text:s/>Oh, and I can control my own blood.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">The ponies looked to the ground where the blood had fallen and saw that it had ball up into a black coagulated blob. <text:s/>A blob that was moving on its own. <text:s/>It jumped into Audrey&apos;s hand as she took a few magic bolts from the guards. <text:s/>They were beginning to panic and fire blindly at her hitting just about everything around. <text:s/>“Good thing those magicy things aren&apos;t lethal, huh.” <text:s/>she commented to the leader as he gaped at the scene from the ground after being hit a couple times. <text:s/>She flung the biomass in her hand in an arc at the guards in front of her and shouted, “Acid Blood.” <text:s/>They all ended up with some of the biomass splattered on them and started flailing around trying to get it off. <text:s/>The soon discovered that it was effectively glued to their coats which lead to them trying to run away. <text:s/>The camp had descended into total chaos as Audrey calmly walked out of it and back into the forest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177"><text:soft-page-break/>“What did you do?” <text:s/>the deer from earlier screeched. <text:s/>She had been waiting at the edge of forest after giving up on finding her barrel. <text:s/>Looking back at the camp Audrey saw the occasional magic bolt fly into the sky and most of the tents had been knocked down. <text:s/>At least one of the ponies was running around with a tent covering him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“I tried to be diplomatic. <text:s/>I don&apos;t think I&apos;m very good at it. <text:s/>They should eventually realize that they are panicking over nothing.” <text:s/>Audrey answered and rolled her shoulder until it popped. <text:s/>“Huh, they actually managed to break my shoulder.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“That&apos;s not nothing, you razed the entire camp.” <text:s/>said the deer as she continued to gawk.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“No, they razed their own camp. <text:s/>I just scared them when they tried to capture me.” <text:s/>Audrey corrected. <text:s/>“Actually, I should diplomacy you too.” <text:s/>Audrey said causing the deer to blanch and give her big doe eyes. <text:s/>“Oh stop that, I&apos;m sure this attempt will go better. <text:s/>Since you already know some of it, I have infected all the trees from here to about half a kilometer in and have no intention of changing that. <text:s/>Don&apos;t try cure these trees or... <text:span text:style-name="T438">you&apos;ll probably end up dead</text:span>.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“That&apos;s not diplomacy, that&apos;s just bullying.” <text:s/>the deer shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“Oh... um, I think I <text:span text:style-name="T438">need to find a teacher then</text:span>... <text:s/>Why do you want to cure the <text:span text:style-name="T438">trees</text:span> anyway? <text:s/>They aren&apos;t going to die or anything. <text:s/>Its mainly so I can make my own food and keep track of any other monsters wandering too close.” <text:s/>Audrey conceded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“I don&apos;t trust you, but I can&apos;t really do anything right now. <text:s/>We will be watching you.” <text:s/>the deer said and walked away. <text:s/>Once out of sight she started running. <text:s/>Audrey returned the blackened trees to normal and removed the virus from the &apos;blood&apos; on the guards after shifting it to wood. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">That should confuse them, </text:span>Audrey thought as she returned her body to a tree and shifted her attention back to her pony body.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">Shortly after breakfast Wild Way was in the main room when she saw the state of the guard camp out the window. <text:s/>She crept up to the window and peeked over the sill. <text:s/>Her ears were flat <text:span text:style-name="T439">against</text:span> her head and <text:span text:style-name="T439">her deep frown hidden under the window</text:span>.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“What&apos;s wrong, dear?” <text:s/>Rose asked and laid a hoof on Wild&apos;s back causing her to tense for a second.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“The camp&apos;s on fire.” <text:s/>Wild <text:span text:style-name="T439">grumbled already planning how to counter the blaze. <text:s/>She started creating underground vesicles throughout the forest a meter or so beneath the ground. <text:s/>She was careful to compact the dirt into biomass to not make any visible terrain disruptions. <text:s/>That would take a few hours, but was easy to delegate to the back of her mind. <text:s/>Once finished she would fill them with water from the aquifer below the forest so she had quick and easy access to enough water to extinguish any inferno. <text:s/>The trees above would be used to vent air or water as needed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“Don&apos;t worry, it looks like they just made a bonfire. <text:s/>It will be gone in a few hours. <text:s/>Although, <text:span text:style-name="T439">I don&apos;t know why they would need one</text:span>.” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T437">Rose placated rubbing Wild&apos;s back. <text:s/>She did relax some but never took her eyes off the bonfire even when Aura joined them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“<text:span text:style-name="T439">It&apos;s too close, it could spark and then... then I would be on fire. <text:s/>All of my trees aflame, an </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T439">unstoppable wildfire.” <text:s/>Wild intoned working herself into a panic as she back away from the window. <text:s/>Rose drew her into a hug before she could get too far though.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P177">“<text:span text:style-name="T439">I&apos;m sure they are making sure that the fire is contained, but what do you mean your trees?” <text:s/>Rose asked before she put the pieces together and added, “Oh, you&apos;re hiding in plain sight as some of the trees?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">Wild nodded and said, “All of the visible ones for a ways into to the forest.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">Aura voiced her approval, but Rose coughed, “There&apos;s nearly a kilometer of tree line visible from here.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">“Does this mean we can play in the Everfree forest?” Aura asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">“No.” <text:s/>Rose answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">Wild managed to make it through the rest of the day only glaring periodically at the bonfire until it was finally burned out. <text:s/>To her confusion the guards had packed up their camp and were moving into the forest. <text:s/>To her surprise more guards showed up not long after and by the evening she had whole platoon camping in her forest. <text:s/>Unfortunately she forgot that camping meant there would be a campfire until she felt the faint heat from the fire.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">That got Wild&apos;s full attention and the first warning the ponies got was a low growl coming from the entire forest around them. <text:s/>In response they started gathering together even the sentries moving toward the campfire in preparation for a fight. <text:s/>Picking one of the trees nearby Wild changed the bark into a mesh of green bioluminescent sacs to illuminate the area. <text:s/>She wanted to see every trace of the fire be eliminated and created a pair of eyes on the same tree. <text:s/>Glaring at the fire she found the cistern underneath the fire that she had made earlier today and let the roof of it begin stretching until it sunk well below the water line creating a muddy mess and obliterating the small campfire. <text:s/>Now that the fire was gone she relaxed and started contracting the cistern roof again using it like a strainer to put the ground mostly back the way it was.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">Now that she was focusing solely on a fire, Wild noticed that her pony body was being shaken. <text:s/>She had fallen limp when her attention shifted and flopped onto the ground with the book she was reading upside down next to her. <text:s/>The other ponies in the home called out variation of &apos;are you OK?&apos; <text:s/>as she got back up. <text:s/>“I&apos;m fine. <text:s/>It&apos;s just the guards decided to make a campfire, so I was paying attention to that instead of this body. <text:s/>Sorry you guys.” <text:s/>She explained.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">“Ah, in the forest you took over.” <text:s/>Rose said nodding. <text:s/>“Try not to give us such a scare next, alright. <text:s/>But, how did you handle it?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">“I made a sink hole under it.” <text:s/>Wild answered listening to the tirade of the leader pony, <text:s/>“Uh, I don&apos;t think their leader is happy about some of the guards falling in.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">“I hope you&apos;re not going to leave them in there.” <text:s/>Rose admonished.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">“I filled the hole back in after the fire died, so its just a shallow mud pit now.” said Wild.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T440">Close enough. <text:s/>You know its OK to have a quiet day.” <text:s/>Rose said with a shake of her head.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P178">“<text:span text:style-name="T440">But then who would keep the monsters away.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">Rose had a false start before she said, “Yeah, I suppose the guard is not really up to the task between the roc yesterday, and them going camping when a storm is scheduled.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“There&apos;s a storm today?” Wild said as the rain started right on cue. <text:s/>“Oh, the leader is trying to the talk to me.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“What&apos;s he trying to do?” <text:s/>Rose asked. <text:s/>Wild <text:span text:style-name="T441">had developed a way to create biological speakers in an attempt to replicate an iPod. <text:s/>She had realized she could not actually use it since she was hiding, but stuck with it since living in the NYZ was filled with dead time. <text:s/>Now would be a perfect time to debut them by relaying what she heard in the forest through her body.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“... <text:span text:style-name="T441">second time you attack the Equestrian army. <text:s/>I am going to end your reign of terror.” <text:s/>the leader shouted.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“<text:span text:style-name="T442">I think you&apos;re overreacting a bit, I was just putting out a fire.” <text:s/>Wild responded nearly causing the leader to bust a vein.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“<text:span text:style-name="T442">You... you use dark magic this morning, and now try to drown 6 of my stallions. <text:s/>Now, you claim you were &apos;just putting out a fire&apos;. <text:s/>Horseapples.” he yelled and descended into kicking at the glowing tree.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P253">“<text:span text:style-name="T442">Wild, what did he mean by &apos;this morning&apos;?” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T289">Rose asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P253"><text:span text:style-name="T289">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T442">I stopped by their camp to convince them not to hunt me. <text:s/>It ended in chaos after my daring escape.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T289">Wild answered before adding, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T442">I&apos;m not very good at diplomacy.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P253">“<text:span text:style-name="T442">We are going to talk about that latter.”</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T289"> <text:s/>Rose said her head in her hooves. <text:s/>Wild folded her ears down at that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P204">“Fire is dangerous, why wouldn&apos;t I react that way?” <text:s/>Wild said, “Also, what&apos;s dark magic by the way?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P204">“You made a 10m wide sinkhole to put out a small fire. <text:s/>You really are insane, and now you&apos;re driving me insane too.” <text:s/>he seethed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P253"><text:span text:style-name="T289">“I really don&apos;t like fire. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T290">Look, can we just agree to leave each other alone, and never make any more <text:s/>fires.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P253"><text:span text:style-name="T290">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">No we can&apos;t just part ways. <text:s/>Now surrender, or we will burn down this tree.” <text:s/>the stallion said before a inaudible rumble began. <text:s/>The ponies could not hear it, but they could feel that the mood had changed drastically.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“<text:span text:style-name="T57">Wild, please don&apos;t hurt them.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T443">Rose requested having some idea of how Wild would react to threats.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“<text:span text:style-name="T443">Do you really think that&apos;s a good idea?” <text:s/>Wild intoned as some of the unicorns surrounded her </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T443">glowing tree. <text:s/>They lit their horns and created a magical shield containing the entire tree. <text:s/>As more ponies came up Wild removed the eyes from the tree and changed the glow to blood red starting from the base of the tree and climbing up through every branch.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“<text:span text:style-name="T443">You&apos;re trapped inside that shield. <text:s/>Now stop hiding in that tree.” <text:s/>the leader demanded. <text:s/>Wild actually complied with that and had her human body exit the tree. <text:s/>However, she left a thick fleshy cord attaching her to the tree and left her eye sockets empty. <text:s/>The ponies flinched at that and the ones not casting were murmuring between themselves. <text:s/>The canopy blocked the rain from soaking the ponies, but the peal of thunder could still be easily heard.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“<text:span text:style-name="T443">You still aren&apos;t a threat to me, but I don&apos;t think you understand how much I dislike fire.” <text:s/>Wild said as she used the cord to lift her body in the air with dangling feet. <text:s/>Using the leverage the cord gave her she threw a punch at the shield in front of the leader. <text:s/>To his credit he did not flinch but all of the casting unicorns recoiled as a solid thump that could be felt by the entire platoon.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“<text:span text:style-name="T58">You&apos;re making the situation worse.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T444"><text:s/>Rose said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P253">“<text:span text:style-name="T444">I was hoping that I could just intimidate them.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P179">“<text:span text:style-name="T443">Your theatrics won&apos;t work, that punch didn&apos;t even crack your cage.” <text:s/>the leader taunted easing some of the tension in his troops. <text:s/>“Now put on these restraints, or I will ignite you.” <text:s/>he said and threw a pair of hoofcuffs through the shield with intricate runes etched into them. <text:s/>Wild did pick them up, and even put them on, but she had no intention of being compliant. <text:s/>Instead she got an idea from the thunder and started drawing water into the tree.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P253">“<text:span text:style-name="T443">Wild, you need to end this now. <text:s/>Just surrender, they can&apos;t do any harm to you.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291"><text:s/>Rose ordered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P253"><text:span text:style-name="T291">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T445">Aw, it was just getting good.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293">Cobalt whined.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P254"><text:span text:style-name="T291">Wild blinked and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">considered the order.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291"> </text:span>“<text:span text:style-name="T444">I did not consider that, intimidation has always been my go to solution.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">She retracted the cord </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">into</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291"> her human body and stood on the ground </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">looking at the hoofcuffs</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">Yeah, I guess you&apos;re right and I don&apos;t really want to kill all of you. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291"><text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">So, I&apos;ll wear these, and all of you will avoid using any fire</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">.” <text:s/>Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">said</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">after picking up the restraints. <text:s/>She felt an electrical tingle</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291"> in </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">the</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291"> branches </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">of her tree. <text:s/>Her eyes widened and she cursed</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">, <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T292">Aw shit.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P254"><text:span text:style-name="T292">A brilliant lightning bolt struck the tree</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">. <text:s/>The </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293">brine</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291"> kept the tree from igniting but a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293">pockets of steam erupted form the bark as the water was superheated</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">. <text:s/>For Wild it was unpleasant but only a little painful, the unicorns maintaining the shield however were on the ground, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293">and the rest of the ponies were covering their ears</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">. <text:s/>The lightning strike had completely demolished the shield when it passed through </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293">and the feedback knocked the casters unconscious</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">. <text:s/>“Ow. <text:s/>That one hurt a little.” she said </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293">while trying to clear her ear with a finger</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T291">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P254">“<text:span text:style-name="T445">What just happened?” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293">Rose asked. <text:s/>The rumble of thunder could be felt inside the building and the audio cut out as Wild hearing was damage as well by the strike.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P254"><text:span text:style-name="T293">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T445">Uh, lightning struck the tree. <text:s/>I knew it was dangerous, but this is more than I expected.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293">Wild marveled as she survey the damage. <text:s/>The conscious ponies were moving at least, although at least one </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T293">was having a seizure. <text:s/>The only one still in a working state were the few earth ponies that were in the platoon. <text:s/>They had been further away from the blast and escaped any physical damage do to their natural resilience. <text:s/>“Hey earth ponies, start checking on the injured. <text:s/>Give a shout if any of them don&apos;t have a pulse.” <text:s/>Wild barked channeling her stolen memories of drill instructors. <text:s/>It gave the guards something familiar to focus on that the eagerly latched onto.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P254"><text:span text:style-name="T293">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T445">Wild, please tell me you didn&apos;t cause that strike.”</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293"> <text:s/>Rose pleaded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P254"><text:span text:style-name="T293">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T445">... I can&apos;t. <text:s/>I tried to use it to break that shield...” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293">Wild confessed while pawing at the ground, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T445">“Lightning is more powerful than I thought.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293">She went from pony to pony doing a quick diagnosis. <text:s/>Several lacked a pulse but she was able to restart their heart in most cases. <text:s/>If nothing else the doctors in Blackwatch did know their trade and now Wild could put that stolen knowledge to a good use.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P254">“<text:span text:style-name="T445">Oh, child...” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T293"><text:s/>Rose sighed and frowned a she considered Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P255"><text:span text:style-name="T83">Wild felt her heart drop as tears pooled in her eyes. <text:s/></text:span>“Do... you hate me, now.” <text:span text:style-name="T83"><text:s/>Wild cried.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P255">“No, but I am disappointed.” <text:span text:style-name="T83">Rose said wiping the tears off of Wild&apos;s face, </text:span>“Ponies make mistakes, and the more powerful they are the worse the consequences. <text:s/>Can you promise me that you won&apos;t hurt anyone else?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P180">After some thought Wild said, “<text:span text:style-name="T13">I can promise to never intentionally harm anyone unless </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T59">they are trying to harm someone</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">.</text:span>”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P255">“...I&apos;ve met attorneys less pedantic.” <text:span text:style-name="T83">Rose said, </text:span>“Yeah, that works. Now say the promise and finish it with: &apos;cross my heart, and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.&apos;” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T83">She even did the motions to go along with the rhyme.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P255">“I swear under threat of hellfire to never intentionally harm anyone unless <text:span text:style-name="T446">they are acting to harm someone</text:span>. <text:s/>Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.” <text:span text:style-name="T83">Wild promised and performed the actions. <text:s/>As soon as they were complete a tingle ran through her entire body including the forest and all of the underground structures. <text:s/>All of the animals and ponies in the forest and Rose&apos;s home felt more than heard a low rumble. <text:s/>Wild hesitated, </text:span>“Uh, what?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P181">“<text:span text:style-name="T13">Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise.” </text:span>Aura explained <text:span text:style-name="T446">before starting a pony pile on Wild</text:span>. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">The effort to treat the injured had progressed to the point that all of them were stable, or dead. <text:s/>Most of them suffered hearing loss and a variety of small cuts. <text:s/>A few of them actually had large splinters embedded in their skin from the steam explosions. <text:s/>Wild was able to treat those easily and they would heal on their own eventually. <text:s/>The worst were three of the casters that had burns starting at their horns. <text:s/>The horns were blackened and cracked leaving little question about their chances. <text:s/>Three body bags would be needed for them.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">The six ponies that had been caught in the mud returned after the most of the ponies had been treated. <text:s/>They had no clue what to do when they found the monster they were looking for working with three of their colleagues. <text:s/>Even more shocking was the fact that over 20 ponies were laying on the ground in various states of injury along with three suspiciously large sealed brown bags.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182"><text:soft-page-break/>“What the buck happened here?” <text:s/>one of new arrivals shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">“Lightning strike.” <text:s/>Wild said and pointed to the mangled tree with scorch marks and craters covering its surface.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">The silence broken one of the earth ponies, a mare this time, asked, “What was that most recent rumble from the forest?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">“A geas more or less.” Wild answered immediately getting the focus of all the conscious ponies, “What, is that a problem?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">“Geas&apos; are banned, and how would you know that, anyway?” <text:s/>one of the freshly cleaned unicorns snapped.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">“Not technically a geas, but it has the same effect. <text:s/>I know because I placed it on myself.” <text:s/>Wild answered and leaned against a tree to observe the reactions. <text:s/>Most of the ponies gave her a raised eyebrow or quirked head, but the earth mare that asked the initial question furrowed her brow in thought.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">“But why would the entire forest react,” <text:s/>she wondered to herself before her eyes landed on the damaged tree. “unless...” she trailed off as the implication came to her. <text:s/>“No way. There&apos;s just no way.” <text:s/>she whispered after blanching at the thought.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">“There&apos;s always a way,” <text:s/>Wild said as she walked off. <text:s/>“and a cost.” she added before disappearing from the ponies line of sight and reintegrating with the forest. <text:s/>A couple of the guards tried to follow, but they were too slow and only found empty forest. <text:s/>In order to stop the guards from making any more fires she set up softly glowing orange bulbs among the trees so the ponies could see. <text:s/>Only one of the ponies had any idea of where they came from.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">As evening turned to night a question plagued Wild. <text:s/>It took a few hours but she did work up the nerve to ask Rose, “Why aren&apos;t you afraid of me?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">“There isn&apos;t really a simple answer to that.” Rose said taking a moment to collect her thoughts. <text:s/>“I&apos;ve been here at this children&apos;s home for a long time and seen many foals come through those doors. <text:s/>Many that have had a hard life and found ways to cope. <text:s/>Being a changeling I get to cheat most of the time, but even though I can&apos;t with you, it has become very obvious that you avoid confrontation. <text:s/>You may go straight to the extremes when you act, but you are closer to a pacifist than some vicious beast. <text:s/>You tried to scare those guards away rather than directly fight them after all.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">Wild&apos;s face screwed up in confusion when she, “Me a pacifist.” <text:s/>She wanted to say that was ridiculous, but thinking back the only time she actually started a fight was with the Blackwatch group that held her captive. <text:s/>The things they did... If that did not count as an extenuating circumstance then nothing would.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P182">After letting Wild mull over those words Rose continued, “Mhm, then there&apos;s the location to consider. <text:s/>This has never been a safe area and not just because of the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Ponies don&apos;t have <text:s/>a very high regard for changelings. <text:s/>Being discovered is a very real, very serious risk. <text:s/>Overall, you <text:soft-page-break/>have made Ponyville a safer place even if the townsponies don&apos;t realize it.”</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P280" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 5</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P264">The moon had set hours ago, but two of the ponies in the forest were still awake. <text:s/>They were the ones tasked with watching over the group for that shift. <text:s/>They had ditched their armor <text:span text:style-name="T447">back by their own tents. <text:s/>Without the armor they no longer had the glamor that made all of the guards look the same. <text:s/>An earth stallion was sitting on the ground on the edge of the camp running his view over the surrounding forest and the other guards. <text:s/>He had a burgundy coat and electric blue mane with a cutie mark of section of plate mail. The other was an earth mare standing next to her partner scanning also scanning the area but her muzzle was scrunched up. <text:s/>She had a green coat with a brown mane and a cutie mark of a trail through a patch of trees.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P264">“<text:span text:style-name="T447">This has been a disaster. <text:s/>Three dead on a simple bounty hunt. <text:s/>Bucking monster summon lightning” the stallion seethed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P264">“<text:span text:style-name="T447">But she helped us afterward.” the mare replied.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P264">“<text:span text:style-name="T447">Oh, and that makes it all better. <text:s/>They&apos;re DEAD, Nature Trail. <text:s/>Three ponies lost their lives today and we don&apos;t even have anything to show for it.” <text:s/>the stallion raged kicking at the ground.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P264">“<text:span text:style-name="T447">No, but I want to know why. <text:s/>Why did she help? <text:s/>Why did she not attack sooner? <text:s/>Why the buck was she so angry about a campfire? Those aren&apos;t the actions of a monster, so what the hay is she?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P264">“<text:span text:style-name="T447">A threat that&apos;s what she is. <text:s/>One we need to get rid of.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">Audrey had once again emerged from tree and joined the ponies without them noticing until she said, “Oh, that&apos;s not true.” <text:s/>The stallion reacted immediately and drew a knife, spun, and stabbed Audrey in the side in the blink of an eye. <text:s/>“Nice reaction time, you got one of my lungs too.” <text:s/>she complimented the mare had taken a more defense stance, but relaxed when she saw Audrey. <text:s/>“And you either don&apos;t think I&apos;m hostile, or realize the futility of trying force.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">The stallion put that claim to the test and repeatedly stabbed at Audrey. <text:s/>“Why... won&apos;t... you... die?!” he said through gritted teeth.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">“I think your partner figured it out. <text:s/>This isn&apos;t my main body. <text:s/>Also, a knife can&apos;t even damage me.” <text:s/>Audrey answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">The stallion finally stopped and asked, “Oh, then where is your main body?” <text:s/>He glared as hard as he could as Audrey grinned in response to his question.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">“Iron Plate, why did you have to ask that?” <text:s/>Nature Trail groaned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">“Oh, this will be fun. <text:s/>I&apos;ll show you, but it will take a little work.” <text:s/>Audrey beamed and walked to the edge of the light from the camp with the ponies reluctantly following. <text:s/>When she stopped a single tendril poked up from ground with a small bulb providing light. <text:s/>An entire ring of the things popped up that could easily encompass a small apartment. <text:s/>More tendrils emerged along the ring until they created <text:soft-page-break/>a short, solid wall. <text:s/>“I should build stuff more often.” she said to herself.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">“What is this, some kind of demonic summoning ritual.” <text:s/>Iron accused.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">“No Iron. I think she is some kind of spirit, a genius loci of the Everfree.” <text:s/>Nature guessed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">“Demons are real here? Huh, but nope I&apos;m not magical so no summoning or spirit.” <text:s/>Audrey said and began consuming the dirt within the ring. <text:s/>The ground slowly sunk down until the some of the tree &apos;roots&apos; were visible. <text:s/>“Oh look, I think that should begin to illustrate my point.” <text:s/>Audrey said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">“Oh dear Celestia, you literally are the forest.” <text:s/>Nature gasped as she staggered watching as more of Audrey&apos;s main body was exposed. <text:s/>Black veins ranging from the size of a pencil to thick enough for a pony to squeeze through and they were moving. <text:s/>Audrey had also added some red lights to them to add to the effect and make sure the ponies could see everything. <text:s/>At the bottom of the hole section of dark red flesh could been seen that the dirt seemed to just disappear into. <text:s text:c="2"/>“OK, this is the most horrifying thing I have seen in my life.” Nature said leaning away from the pit before stammering, “I&apos;m sorry I didn&apos;t mean to insult you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P265">“I&apos;ve developed a penchant for horror, so don&apos;t worry it just looks scary. The reality is much worse, but don&apos;t worry about that.” <text:s/>Audrey said. <text:s/>Iron Plate had left the group while the two were talking. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T13">Oh, this should be good, when he other guards show up, s</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">he thought.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205">“What is the reality?” Nature asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205">“You can&apos;t do anything about it, and it would just cause a panic. <text:s/>Seriously, I&apos;m not your enemy so just be grateful you don&apos;t actually need to fight me.” Audrey said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205">“Like hay you&apos;re not hostile, you killed three ponies. <text:s/>Now tell me what the reality is?” <text:s/>Nature demanded. <text:s/>As soon as the words were out, Audrey heard the sound of phantom flames and was hit with the distinct smell of burning fuel. <text:s/>The veins in the pit that had been slowly wriggling all stopped and her eyes unfocused as she fought to maintain control of her panic.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P256">Fuck, she actually triggered that damned geas, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey fumed in her mind. <text:s/>“You just had to ask again. <text:s/>Fine.” Audrey growled, “First, I did not kill them, I got them killed. I tried to cause the bolt to hit the shield and underestimated it. <text:s/>I took most of the hit, it wasn&apos;t enough, but that bolt was going to hit nearby one way or another.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205">“The reality that you are so interested in is wonderful little pit of madness.” Audrey grumbled now resigned to giving a detailed answer, “A couple good things are that my mind is pretty close to a pony&apos;s and I tend to be pacifistic, its enforced by a geas even. So no alien motives or world conquest to worry about from me. <text:s/>I haven&apos;t actually tried to hurt any of your group, just some intimidation and a poor attempt at influencing lightning.” The guard that had recently left had retrieved his commanding officer who had promptly run up to Audrey and attempted to buck her into the pit. She had noticed him long before he got in range and simply sidestepped once he committed to the attack. <text:s/>With his hind legs fully extended she grabbed one and flung him into the pit instead where he landed on one of the larger cords. <text:s/>“Quit it, I&apos;m not in the mood for games.” <text:s/>Audrey shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205"><text:soft-page-break/>“Now, I may have a mind similar to a pony, but my brain, if you can call it that, is another matter entirely. <text:s/>It&apos;s distributed through my whole body, I have no vital points. <text:s/>You would have to completely destroy me if you wanted to kill me. <text:s/>It&apos;s also much more resilient to trauma and lets me keep track of all the information I receive such as the various animals around the forest or your entire platoon including every conversation you have had.” Audrey said. <text:s/>The CO had managed to climb out and a few more of the guards arrived. <text:s/>They had even brought armor and weapons with them. <text:s/>Audrey projected her voice through the area as she sat down and continued, “I&apos;m not going to go into my history, but I have been through literal torture and come out of it with a whole list of neurosis. <text:s/>Pyrophobia and sociopathy <text:s text:c="2"/>are the most relevant ones for you. <text:s/>Enough paranoia to know that a pony is trying to stab me in the back, too.” <text:s/>Said pony thrust the sword forward now that he was discovered, but <text:s/>Audrey did not move and once more had a sword impaling her. “I hope you aren&apos;t the same guard as last time. Otherwise you might need smarter recruits.” <text:s/>Audrey said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205">“Now I am going to tell you some strategically important information, and I want all of you to consider what it would be like to actually fight against me. <text:s/>The first thing is that I don&apos;t have a fix form or size. If there is a limit to either of those I have not found it yet. That pit there is my part of my body and if you could see through the dirt then you would know that this section is the same as about 100 acres of land along the forest border. <text:s/>There are also more roots that extend beyond that in every direction some going as far as the border of Ponyville. Other roots extend downward all the way to bedrock a few hundred meters below ground. Thats just were I stopped. I can go further but this seems like a good enough start to me. Now if I decided to fight you seriously how do think that would go. <text:s/>Oh, and remember you have to destroy every part. <text:s/>Of a forest that would be trying to eat you alive.” Audrey stated to the now pallid faces of the guards, “That&apos;s what happened to the last thing that earn my ire. Word of advice, don&apos;t try to eat me. Was that all you wanted to know?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P205">“Why are you here?” Nature asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P256"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“I&apos;m in this forest because Gaea abducted me and left me here. I don&apos;t know who she is or why she did it.” <text:s/>Audrey said, “I set up shop in this particular location because of Ponyville. I like having ponies around so I put myself between them and the other creatures here.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T295">She sighed in relief now that the sound of flames died down.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P256"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T295">You appointed yourself as some kind of guardian for Ponyville because you were lonely.” Nature deadpanned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P206">“Yup, although I&apos;m trying to establish this as my territory so that other large monsters will just stay away.” <text:s/>Audrey chirped.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P206">“OK, what the hay? <text:s/>You just went from pissed to chipper in nothing flat.” one of guards that had showed up asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P206">“I&apos;m under a few geas, and this pony,” Audrey huffed and poked Nature, “triggered one of them.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P206">“Um, sorry.” the pony gulped, but Audrey just told her not to worry.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P256"><text:span text:style-name="T295">“Nice story, but you are still a dangerous monster. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T297">Now that you have all but confirmed that fire is </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T297">your weakness</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T295"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T297">y</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T295">ou will </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T296">leave or </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T297">I will burn you to ashes</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T296">.” the CO said with a glowing horn from outside </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T297">easy </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T296">reach of Audrey. <text:s/>The rest of the ponies started backing </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T297">away</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T296"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T297">from the two of them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P207">“One of the geasan on me prevents lying, everything I have said is true. Another of them prevents me from attacking first. I won&apos;t start a fight, but I will end it.” Audrey intoned staring her opponent in the eyes, “If you hit me with fire I will kill you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P207">“Sargent, I think she is telling the truth. You should really listen.” Nature Trail pleaded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P207">“The Equestrian army does not negotiate with monsters.” the Sargent replied as he loosed his magic. A fireball engulf Audrey before she could get up from her sitting position leaving behind a large fire. <text:s/>A drop fell onto the Sargent as the fire died down to reveal Audrey standing with patches of flesh burned off and her clothes singed. <text:s/>A couple more drops fell onto the Sargent as he charged up his next attack and matched Audrey&apos;s glare with his own. The rain continued hitting him even as he began to feel an itch on the back of his neck. <text:s/>His horn lost its glow when he felt something biting into his shoulder and went to knock it off. He found a drop of thick red liquid on his shoulder and tried to brush it off, but it was stuck to his fur.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P207">“You know its usually a bad idea to try to fight something when you are essentially inside its stomach.” Audrey rasped through the burns. The ponies who had been watching frantically looked around when they heard that except for Nature Trail. <text:s/>She was watching the Sargent instead as a small shower of something was falling on him from the branches above. <text:s/>When he started scratching at himself the shower tappered off to a stop in a few seconds. <text:s/>“You really should have just listened, but now you are dying.” Audrey said as she healed her throat, “the rest of you should return to sleep soon, so you can get to the hospital when the storm breaks. <text:s/>Don&apos;t worry about a watch, I&apos;ll continue keeping the animals away from you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P256"><text:span text:style-name="T297">“Don&apos;t ignore me, this fight isn&apos;t over.” raged the Sargent. <text:s/>With the feverish scratching and the now painful burning sensation he was unable to use any magic or even remain standing. <text:s/>Blood could be seen mixing with the red rain as it stained his coat. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T298">He tried to maintain his composure, but it was clear that he was in agony and it was only getting worse.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P256"><text:span text:style-name="T297">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T298">No, it&apos;s over. <text:s/>That&apos;s not acid, you won&apos;t be able to remove it without removing large pieces of yourself too. If the rest of you want to try helping him go for it. It won&apos;t hurt you if you touch it.” Audrey said. None of the ponies were eager to help, but one of the braver ones hesitantly tried to pull the red mass off. <text:s/>Seeing that he was unharmed more of them tried to help as well, but it had little affect.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P208">“Holy shit, I&apos;m am just going to take you at your word in the future.” <text:s/>Nature Trail stammered from next to Audrey. “Are you really digesting him?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P208">“Oh yes, lucky for him he will die of shock shortly. When I went through the same thing I was fully conscious for the entire process. Didn&apos;t even get to stay dead afterward either.” Audrey answered. The ponies had stopped trying to save their leader and instead watched in morbid curiosity as his body melted. <text:s/>His head had already disappeared leaving behind an empty helmet. “Alright lets see what he <text:soft-page-break/>had in his head... a bit arrogant... no kids, but a marefriend... his parents won&apos;t be happy with the news... Wait, what?” Audrey said as she sorted through the new memories, “Really, basic training is just swords play and some PT. <text:s/>Oh, a few basic combat spells too, but the armor really is a gold alloy.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P208">“Where are you getting that information from?” Nature asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P208">“I get the memories from what I consume if their brain is intact. <text:s/>It looks like Equestria has a problem, monsters are showing up and you guys don&apos;t have an adequate defense.” Audrey said as she stroked her chin trying to decide what if anything to do about the problem. <text:s/>Nature opened her mouth to disagree, but just closed it again after a moment of thought.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P208">“You&apos;re some kind of zombie?” Nature asked instead.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P208">“No, there was no necromancy involved, I just ended up merged with a biological super-weapon created to exterminate civilizations. <text:s/>It&apos;s a bit of a mixed bag, but I can at least keep it in check so that&apos;s good. Hey, you are interested in the safety of Equestria, right?” Audrey rambled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P209">Nature&apos;s ears were plastered to her head and tail tucked between her legs as she replied, “...Yes, where are you going with this?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P209">“Well, it seems you got a bit of a monster problem in your nation, so I would like you to listen and understand what I am going to tell you and take it to your leaders. It seems that a land grab has started and I have claimed Ponyville. Luckily, I&apos;m also currently neutral to Equestria so I&apos;m pretty much just sitting here keeping other monsters away. I think you already have a good idea of what would happen should we become enemies, but remember I never said I told you everything.” Audrey explained to the pony. <text:s/>Nature&apos;s eyes widened at the last part of the explanation.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P257"><text:span text:style-name="T83">Audrey continued saying, “This is the real important part, the best choice in my opinion. You could simply ask instead of trying to force things. I may be scary and kinda creepy, but as long as you don&apos;t force a confrontation this is probably the least dangerous place you have ever been. I was still a filly when I got horribly mutilated both physically and mentally, and I will </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T299">love me some fluffy ponies if I want.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P210">“Did you seriously forget that you have a sword in your stomach?” one of the guards said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P210">“What?” Audrey asked and looked down, “Huh, that&apos;s still there. Thanks.” she pulled it out and dropped it on the ground. <text:s/>“Well, the storm will break soon so you guys can get to the hospital, or you could stay here. Either one works.” she said and took a step toward the open pit.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P210">“Wait, that storm is still around?” Nature asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P210">“It is, the lightning has died down, but I have been shunting the rain into the water table so that&apos;s probably why you didn&apos;t notice. Anyway, bye guys. You know where to find me.” Audrey chirped before jumping into the pit, dissolving her body and merging with the biomass at the bottom.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P210">“What the flying feather just happened?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P210">“That mare is insane.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P210"><text:soft-page-break/>“She was kinda hot, though.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P210">“You know she can still here you.” Nature Trail deadpanned with a twitching eye. The silence was deafening as she went back to the camp.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P258"><text:span text:style-name="T83">The following day Wild made sure to tell Rose about the increase in monster activity as well as her observations of the Equestrian army. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T300">Rose was not happy to learn how she came across the knowledge, but she accepted Wild&apos;s reasoning with the caveat that Wild would learn to better defuse situations.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P259"><text:span text:style-name="T83">The guards returned from the forest during the late morning. <text:s/>They split into to groups most going to the hospital, while the earth pony ones went to the train station with a few of the unicorns that escaped injury. Their state and fact they dodged most of the townsponies questions increase</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T301">d</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83"> the worry of the town.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P260"><text:span text:style-name="T83">Wild however was busy exploring the brand new knowledge she had. Most of the memories of anything magical other than theory were incomplete. The knowledge was likely stored in the soul which she could not touch. Notably the ability to detect magic was physical and accessible to Wild. Something was still missing when she tried since she just saw a uniform hazy. The memories clearly showed that the new sense should have been able to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T302">the flow of magic in creatures. She did repurpose it into a magic detector to measure the strength of nearby magic so it was not a complete loss.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P211">She spent the day exploring with her new ability to get a sense of the magic in the town. Once she made sense of the scale she was sensing she was surprised that the library produced enough power to run a small city. She had also added the sensors to her trees and found the background and noise levels to be much higher than the town. Looking closer at the data she found a few regular signals in the mess that were large enough to be felt. The pulses meant that the magic was being used for something. Wild was not happy to learn she was not the only one in her weight class.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P261"><text:span text:style-name="T83">The most concerning was the strongest signal, but not just because of its strength. The other signals could be seen moving through her forest as it passed through each tree. <text:s/>The strongest one on the other hand appeared to hit all of the trees at the same time. The only explanation she could come up with was that there was something with orders of magnitude more power than anything else around and at least a kilometer under the ground. <text:s/>Even more unnerving was the fact the magic was </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T303">currently being used</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P284" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 6</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P266"><text:span text:style-name="T145">W</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">ild was at the library to find out if there was anything on large sources of magic. She did have some possible theories, but they was very little in the way of solid confirmation. One of the sources she was interested in was likely lay lines, a large network of magical fonts and channels that distribute magic throughout the world. Another possibility was the Heart of Magic, a periodic beat in the magical field. The ponies assumed it was some aspect of the magical field itself, but Wild was not convinced. She figured it was another point source like all the other magical pulses, which would mean it was much deeper than she thought and far more powerful as well. Worse, no one even had a theory on its purpose, most assumed it was simply there and never looked further.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P262"><text:soft-page-break/>OK, I need some way to counter magic, <text:span text:style-name="T83">Wild thought as she browsed for a biology book, </text:span>ponies use magic surely they can stop it too.<text:span text:style-name="T83"> She found a book on pony anatomy and set to studying, </text:span>pony magic is created in their fat. Strange, but how does that work, <text:span text:style-name="T83">she flipped through the book for a hint. She fund her hint in a diagram of a fat cell. The first thing that stood out to Wild was a crystal contained in one of the organelles. <text:s/>That was not something any Earth creature had. </text:span>That&apos;s a crystallized protein, how did they manage that? Wait, I&apos;m a pony how did I manage that? Wish I could actually see the process within my cells. <text:span text:style-name="T83">Some trial and error and she was able to isolate the protein and crystallize it on a larger scale. Now more than an hour later and she was staring at a large crystal on the floor that she pulled out of her mane.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P262"><text:span text:style-name="T83">The crystal looked like a collection of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T305">white opaque</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83"> overlapping cubes. It was about half the size of a hoof and sat unmoving with no visible change whatsoever. </text:span>Don&apos;t know what I thought it was going to do,<text:span text:style-name="T83"> Wild thought as she went to pick it back up. When she touched it a small spark of static electric arced to her hoof causing her to pull back and squeak in surprise.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P212">“What happened?” Twilight who had been reading her own book asked when she heard the squeak, “Why do you have an uncut gem?” As Twilight approached to get a better look the crystal gave off more small pops. “I&apos;ve never heard of a clear crystal that generates lightning. Do you mind if I take a closer look?” Twilight asked and received a nod from Wild. Twilight tried to use her telekinesis on the gem, but instead of levitating it started throwing off visible arcs of electricity. She quickly stopped trying to lift it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P212">“Cool,” Wild grinned and clapped her hooves, “You should try again, for science.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P262"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“No, this gem is dangerous. It absorbed all of the magic I was using on it. It must be near flawless for a gem that size to do that.” Twilight said. Wild already knew it was flawless, one of the advantages of having an army of cells to assemble things. “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T304">Where did you get this?” Twilight asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P184">“Um... The forest lady,” Wild mumbled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P184">“Who is the forest lady?” Twilight asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P184">“You know the one that made that bird go away.” Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P184">“You went to the Everfree forest!” Twilight shouted, “Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P262"><text:span text:style-name="T304">“Yes, she took over that part of the forest, so everything dangerous stays away.” Wild said, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T449">Now just spread that around and I might even get a decent reputation.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">Twilight frowned at that, “She defeat a platoon of guards, she is one of those dangerous things. She could have hurt you if she caught you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“What? She&apos;s weird, but nice enough unless you threaten her. You can just walk up and talk to her, no problem.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“How did you find her, the guards spent a day searching?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183"><text:soft-page-break/>“Oh, they just didn&apos;t know what they were looking for. All you have to do is walk up and talk to one of the trees.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“There&apos;s no way she can hear you from any of the trees, that&apos;s impossible.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“That&apos;s what you said about my gray eyes too. She lives underground, that whole section of the forest is kinda her back and the trees are like... back fur.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“What?” Twilight squeaked, “That&apos;s... Just how much of the forest is she?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Hundred acres.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Oh, that&apos;s... a lot of land, and there&apos;s a giant monster sleeping under it.” Twilight said as she walked away in a daze.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Maybe you should try talking to her.” Wild commented as she looked at the crystal still waiting on the floor. <text:span text:style-name="T13">Well found my answer to magic, </text:span>she thought before she picked it up in her mouth. There were still a few shocks, but she ignored them and bit down hard enough to crack the gem. She reabsorbed the fragments as she left the library.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">Not long after leaving Wild finds a griffon walking down the street. Now curious she begins following the griffon around. It seemed at least this griffon did not get along well with ponies. She was abrasive and a bit rude. She even roared at a yellow Pegasus that was leading around ducks. Wild took that as a cue and ran up to the griffon to give her own roar. The most ferocious one a filly could give.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“What are you doing kid?” the griffon asked clearly not impressed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Roaring” Wild replied</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Ponies can&apos;t roar.” the griffon deadpanned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Oh yeah, well how about this.” Wild said and drew in a huge breath. She gave the deepest lion roar she could. It was plenty convincing even if she could not get the full volume judging by all the stares the two had attracted. “How was that?” she chirped.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Uh, yeah... that&apos;s pretty good.” the griffon said and tried to walk away.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Thanks.” Wild said matching pace, “I&apos;m Wild Way, I can make animal calls.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Gilda.” the griffon said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“What brings you to Ponyville?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Meeting a friend. Look kid don&apos;t you have something else to do?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P183">“Nope, I&apos;m just enjoying the culture clash.” Wild said receiving an eye twitch from the griffon. “<text:span text:style-name="T450">You need to be more kind or fake it. Ponies don&apos;t respond well to force.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T60">Huh, I should probably follow my own advice, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T450">Wild thought as the griffon flew away. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T60">Note to self try being nice to pony guards, still scare the shit out of deer. Maybe a nice little apartment thing in the big hole. Yeah ponies like houses that will work.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P185"><text:soft-page-break/>Wild returned home, and by the end of the day she had grown a basic apartment. She even added a tall oak tree tower on top with a large flat area in the center of the top. <text:s/>Several giant branches had walkways that led to parapets poking out of the leaves. Large roots extend from the trunk along the ground and two of them had a ground depression between them with a circular door where the roots split apart.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P185">Inside the building, the walls were done in Tudor style with green tinted living wood and a slight blue tint on the paneling. The flooring was made of wooden planks a few shades darker than the walls. Lighting was provided by more glowing bulbs stuck along joints between the tree acting as a ceiling and the walls. <text:s/>One side of the main room had a spiraling staircase leading up the tree tower and the other side had four doors. <text:s/>Two for a bedroom, and storage both empty. One to a full bathroom complete with working plumbing, but no mirror. The last door lead to a long tunnel that ran through the various cisterns to another door in a tree at the edge of the forest. The back wall of the main room had a large sink, trash can, and a pantry. Unlike a normal pantry this on had various fruits and vegetables attached to the walls. They would stay fresh indefinitely and regrow when picked. <text:span text:style-name="T13">Just need some ponies now, and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T61">some </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T13">furniture.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">The first guest to stay in her new house was not a pony, but a griffon. The same one from earlier that showed up at the forest fuming. “Psst, hey you.” Wild shispered from the trees.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“What?” the griffon snapped as she looked around for who was talking, “What do you want kid?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“Do griffons like scary things?” Wild asked</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“Just go home kid. I&apos;m not in the mood.” Gilda shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“I&apos;ll take that as a yes.” Wild said before creating a pony skull and dropping it behind Gilda. Gilda whipped around ready to shout at a pony, but only found a skull.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“That&apos;s it, a skull. That&apos;s not scary.” Gilda said and kicked the skull away. When she turned around her way was blocked a small pile of skulls. “Uh, OK, thats a bit better.” she said and stepped past the pile.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“Thanks. I&apos;m curious did no one warn you about this forest?” Wild said setting up the next trick. When Gilda walked under the next branch the another skull dropped from the tree this one still had gristle attached and a full spinal column.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“Something about a monster, probably just spooked by the wind. Although, I&apos;m starting to think you&apos;re the monster.” Gilda said as she poked at the new partial skeleton and sniffed it. “How did you make it smell like meat?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“Guilty, I&apos;m Athena the local spooky monster. Don&apos;t worry I&apos;ll only kill you if light a fire, and that is real meat.” Athena said causing Gilda to quickly back away with flared wings.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“OK, yeah, that&apos;s pretty scary. Can we stop with the skulls?” Gilda gulped.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“Alright, if it makes you feel better none of those were from a pony, I can just grow the things myself.” Athena said as she walked out from behind a tree. She grabbed the skull and tossed it up into <text:soft-page-break/>the canopy. “So, what brings you here anyway? This is neither the time nor place for a stroll.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">Gilda looked up to try and see where the skull went. “I was staying with a friend. Turns out she wasn&apos;t the friend I thought.” she grimaced.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P186">“You can stay in my house.” Athena chirped as she herded the griffon to her brand new house. <text:span text:style-name="T451">She created a bed and other amenities as needed before leaving a very uncertain griffon for the night. Gilda eventually settled down for the night and went to sleep. In the morning she left via the tunnel and few of somewhere. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T62">A successful test run, now I just need to find a way to get some ponies in there.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">Prepared for the next encounter with the guards, Wild went back to her crystal project. The first one produced electricity when magic was applied, but inside ponies they produced magic. At a complete loss on what to do she decided to ask Rose. Wild found her in the dining area reading the newspaper.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“Mama Rose, do you know anything about magic gems.” Wild asked and pulled a gem similar to the one she showed Twilight out of her mane.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“Some, what did you need?” Rose asked as she looked at the white gemstone. It gave off a tiny spark as she was watching and she asked, “Where did you find that?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“I made it, it converts magic to electricity. The reverse should work too, but I don&apos;t know how.” Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“You made a gem?” Rose said, “Have you tried shocking it back?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“Um, I don&apos;t know how to make electricity. Oh, and its actually crystallized protein.” Wild said and hoofed the gem over to Rose.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“You can make a gem out of protein, but not a static charge.” Rose chuckled, “Now I&apos;m going to need my horn for this, are you OK with a small transformation?” Wild responded by covering her eyes and nodding. A short whoosh of fire, and another much louder pop let her know that she could look again. Now the gem was completely clear and glowing slightly. Rose had a long black horn poking out of her mane, but was otherwise unchanged. “Well it certainly did something.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P188">“How do we know if it worked?” Wild asked as <text:span text:style-name="T452">High Road</text:span> entered the room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“What kind of magic are you doing?” he asked noting Rose&apos;s horn as he joined them at the table.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“Wild here has <text:span text:style-name="T452">a unique gem that might create magic.” Rose said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T452">It&apos;s a giant version of what ponies use to make magic.” Wild elaborated.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T452">Really, so what, it eats food then?” High Road asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T452">It seems to use lightning, let&apos;s see what it does?” Rose said before zapping the stone again. In response it began to glow slightly and threw off a glowing white sparks everywhere. “Amazing, I thought these were mythical. There are rumors about ancient ruins that had diamonds that could produce pure magic. To actually see a lapis vitae...” Rose said with wide eyed awe when she absorbed the sparks into her horn.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T453">Lapis vitae, stone of life.” Wild said, “I wonder why it&apos;s called that... Uh oh, they probably got the material from living ponies and thought it was their life force. That will make for some interesting assumptions.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T454">Please don&apos;t tell me you made this out of somepony.” Rose said with a frown.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T454">No, just a little genetic tinkering and anything alive can produce it. Although, I am probably the only one that can change gene easily. It&apos;s what virus&apos; do after all.” Wild said then squinted at the stone, “I have no idea what to do with them though.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T455">You could make an ancient ruin to explore, like Daring Do.” High Road suggests.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T454">How many of these can you make?” Rose asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T455">Uh, of that size, as many as you want. I could probably also make one the size of a pony in about day or so. They would still need to be zapped though.” Wild said pulling a new white gem out of her mane with both fore hooves. She put the new gems down on the table already popping with electricity. Curiosity got the best of her and she pushed one of the white gems next to the clear one. As it got closer the arcs started jumping between the two gems and some of the magic sparks floated to the opaque gem. When they finally touched a final tiny pop occurred and both gems began to visibly lose energy. The arcs and glowing stopped so she separated them again. The smell of burnt hair caused everyone else to hold their nose. Looking at the gem the point of contact was blackened and looked slightly deformed. “So it just all ends up as heat when they touch.” Wild said satisfied with her experimenting.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T456">And it stinks!” High Road said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T456">Did you really need to try that?” Rose deadpanned again as the white gem started arcing again, “Would you mind if I kept the lapis vitae?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T456">No problem” Wild said as she pushed the once again glowing lapis vitae to Rose.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T456">What do you want that gem for?” High Road asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T456">We changelings can actually eat pure magic, but this gem is about the only thing that produces that.” Rose explained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T456">Oh, so you won&apos;t have to rely on ponies then.” Wild said, “I can make bigger ones if you need.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P187">“<text:span text:style-name="T457">That&apos;s alright, but for now I want to see what I can do with this one.” Rose said right before someone knocked on the door. She got up and hid her horn again as she went to go see who it was. Wild however did not feel any fear at the small display of fire to her surprise. She also ate the other two gems much to High Road&apos;s surprise.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">Wild was called to the front door after a few minutes. When she got there she saw another unicorn guard. This one however was wearing purple armor and was accompanied by Twilight Sparkle. “Hi, Twilight.” chirped Wild with a wave. Twilight gave a hesitant wave back. A few more guards could be seen standing in the background.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“Hello Wild Way, I&apos;m Shining Armor the Captain of the Royal Guard. I understand that you had a <text:soft-page-break/>white gem yesterday that you showed my sister. Do you still have it?” Shining Armor said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“No, I returned it to the forest lady.” Wild said getting a groan from the captain.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“Alright, do you know where she got it from?” he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“Yes, she made it.” Wild said. That got a gasp from both ponies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“Alright, thank you for answering my questions.” said the captain dismissing Wild who went to the window inside. <text:span text:style-name="T13">This like having TV all over again, </text:span>Wild thought. The captain, librarian, and accompanying guard could be seen approaching the nearby forest. Rose along with High Road joined Wild at the window and she began to broadcast the sounds from the forest again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“Monster, I am the captain of the royal guard, Shining Armor, show yourself.” the captain yelled loud enough for nearly the entire town to hear.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">Athena walked out of the forest to meet the him, but she decided to dress up as her namesake. She wore a white toga with a sash of bronze colored scales from her shoulder to the opposite waist. On her head was an undecorated bronze helmet the covered the back of her neck, but left her face fully uncovered and had a bright red plume on the top. In her left hand was a white shield with a green geometric border and a stylized head of Medusa in green relief. Her right hand held a basic spear with an engraving of an owl on both sides of the bone spear head. In addition she had used compressed biomass for the entire form making her well over a ton even though she was only 6 feet tall. “You don&apos;t have to shout, I can hear you just fine.” Athena said stopped with spear pointed straight up on the ground as a staff, “<text:span text:style-name="T459">I am Athena, no titles yet, </text:span>so what can I do for you today?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">The six guards behind the captain began whispering and Twilight moved behind them. “You have been terrorizing this town for too long. I am here to remove you, by force if necessary. <text:span text:style-name="T458">In addition it has come to my attention that you are in possession of a null stone.” Shining said. A few ponies have started gathering up to see what was happening.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P190">“<text:span text:style-name="T459">I have no idea what a null stone is, so maybe there are many stones in the forest after all. Removing me is not even feasible, don&apos;t know what the big deal is. The town has been near the Everfree for centuries, why does one more monster matter?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“<text:span text:style-name="T459">Null stone are white gemstones that nullify magic. They are unstable and give off lightning randomly.” Twilight said before grimacing for the next part, “They can only be made by harvesting life force.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“<text:span text:style-name="T459">Ah so that&apos;s what they are called. That last part isn&apos;t true though. Question, does harvesting life force prevent a pony from replenishing mana?” Athena said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“<text:span text:style-name="T459">If you know the symptoms I can only assume you have already done the ritual.” Shining said, “I am placing you under arrest.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“<text:span text:style-name="T459">I&apos;m going to guess that these stones haven&apos;t been seen in centuries or something.” Athena chuckled, “I&apos;m a biologist, not a magicy whatever. Null stones are just a crystallized protein.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T459">A protein?” Twilight repeated. She received a nod from Athena, but was lost in her own mind, “That makes sense... removing proteins from somepony can produce all kinds of effects.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“<text:span text:style-name="T459">You should have already learned about me in the debriefing. Did they forget to mention my size, or do you just not believe them?” Athena asked Shining, “I haven&apos;t the slightest clue how you could restrain me in the first place.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“<text:span text:style-name="T459">Will you come quietly?” Shining asked as he got into an aggressive stance and lit his horn.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P189">“<text:span text:style-name="T469">No. I don&apos;t know how to fight let alone do it with a spear and shield, so this should be interesting.” Athena said getting into her own stance. It was not a real fighting stance.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P191">The captain started firing magic bolts at Athena, but they did next to nothing due to her density. She closed range and tried to whack shining with her spear, <text:span text:style-name="T460">but he jumped back. She swung it the other way and extended the shaft surprising the stallion. He still managed to dodge it by jumping over it, but Athena stopped the spear, and this time had the tip arc over his back without moving the shaft. He didn&apos;t notice until he was almost wrapped up in the coil, but teleported behind Athena. She immediately found him and dropped the now bent spear to attempt to grab him. Teleporting again he reappeared at range off to Athena&apos;s left.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P191">“<text:span text:style-name="T460">Well, this is kinda fun. That teleporting is going to complicate things.” Athena said as she stands up fully, “How will you respond to this.” Athena takes a deep breath before blowing out a large cloud of green particles at Shining Armor. He narrows his eyes, and runs to the side before the cloud reaches him. Athena follows him with the gas, but has to stop shortly leaving a large area with a lingering cloud over it. Another cloud was pushed over the green one that started to rain. Soon both clouds were gone and Athena said, “Clever, fair warning though, no fire. You can ask your brother later.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P191">“<text:span text:style-name="T461">Twily, stay out of this! I can handle it.” Shining said pulling out a steel long sword.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P191">“<text:span text:style-name="T461">Don&apos;t worry we&apos;re just having a bit of fun.” Athena said and shifted her right hand into a broad sword blade made of bone with a red and black veins running along the inside edge. A teleport later and Shining was at the rear right side of Athena with sword already in motion. She spun and blocked the sword with her shield before swinging her blade at the stallion. This time a magical shield appeared and block her blade. The captain jumped back to disengage, but could clearly be seen panting. Unfortunately for him he landed next to the previously discarded spear. The spear wrapped around his hindleg and buried its head into the ground. Athena relaxed now that the battle was over.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P192">In one last teleport Shining appeared at Athena&apos;s shoulder already swinging the sword at her neck. When the blade hit her neck it bit in, but stopped almost immediately leaving only a small nick. The stallion landed on his hooves and was ready to take another swing, but the leg that was grabbed by the spear gave out and he tumbled over. Athena returned her blade to a hand, and reabsorbed the shield while also having the spear burrow into the ground. “Well, that was fun. Here comes your sister.” she said to the downed pony.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P192">“Shiny are you OK?!” Twilight shouted trying to inspect him. Athena had undone the muscle paralysis in his leg that she caused. He did not really need to know about it. “What did you do to him <text:soft-page-break/>you monster?” Twilight demanded after she whirled to face Athena.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P192">“He&apos;s just a little tired.” Athena said as she picked him up and set him on his hooves, “See good as new.” He wobbled a bit at the sudden orientation change, but <text:span text:style-name="T469">stayed standing</text:span>. Not surprising, he was just purged of adrenaline.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P263">“Heh, and just like that the Royal Guard is compromised.<text:span text:style-name="T83">” Wild giggled back at home.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P263"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“</text:span>Because you won?” <text:span text:style-name="T83">Aura asked. The rest of the house had shown up during the battle as well as a crowd of Ponyvillians.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P263"><text:span text:style-name="T83">“</text:span>Not quite. When the spear grabbed him I infected him with an asymptomatic version of my virus.” <text:span text:style-name="T83">Wild explained. The foals had no idea what that meant, but the adults were staring with gaping mouths so it must be a big deal.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P263">“<text:span text:style-name="T462">For the love of the Earth Mother, keep this one close.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T307">Citrine whispered to Rose.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P263">“<text:span text:style-name="T462">That&apos;s what the lady who summoned me here said her name was.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T307">Wild noted. That did not reduce the intensity of the stares at all.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P285" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 7</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93">“<text:span text:style-name="T463">So did you accomplish whatever your goal was?” Athena asked Shining Armor.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93">“<text:span text:style-name="T463">You&apos;re right, you have no fighting skills whatsoever.” he said between pants, “How in the world did you know where I was going to teleport?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93">“<text:span text:style-name="T463">Yup, I rely on misdirection and overwhelming advantages, like using high frequency sonar instead of sight.” Athena said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93">“<text:span text:style-name="T463">What are you two doing?” Twilight screamed, “Why are you talking like friends?” She took a defensive position next to her brother.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93">“<text:span text:style-name="T463">It&apos;s the only logical choice. I&apos;m not hostile, and it would take to entirety of the armed forces to even have a chance to remove me from here. This body” Athena said and indicated herself, “is just an avatar. I figured it would ease conversation if I at least looked like a mammal. Also, this is my original form so I&apos;m somewhat fond of it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93">“<text:span text:style-name="T463">You&apos;re a shape shifter!” Twilight got out before an object impacted Athena&apos;s shoulder. She managed to catch it after it bounced off and when she saw it was a crossbow bolt licked the tip.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93">“<text:span text:style-name="T463">Huh, that sniper&apos;s back, good thing they can aim well. Still using curare even.” Athena said as she moved to block the line of fire to the ponies. Shining gave a hoof signal to guards accompanying him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93">“<text:span text:style-name="T463">She is right, we can&apos;t get rid of her, especially not with other monsters popping up.” the captain sighs, “now vigilantes are showing up, and the whole world seems to be going crazy. Those null stones are a concern. Ponies are starting to go missing too, so either you&apos;re lying or something else is causing it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T464">I can&apos;t lie, but you already know that. This is the first I&apos;ve heard about anyone missing. I don&apos;t even form this body most of the time unless something happens.” Athena said looking into the sky, “Like that incoming roc. This will be interesting. It might be a good idea to calm the town.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P193">Both siblings looked toward the approaching bird. Twilight set off presumably to warn the ponies, but Shining stayed behind. “I loath you.” he seethed dropping his facade now that Athena was the only one nearby. “You killed 4 of my stallions, and you just don&apos;t care at all do you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P194"><text:span text:style-name="T466">A deep rumble could be felt in the ground before it slowly climbed in pitch to a deep roar. The roc stumbled in its flight, but kept coming causing Athena to tsk. </text:span>“<text:span text:style-name="T465">You&apos;re right, I am a monster after all. Everyone I loved was killed, everything I had was destroyed, even my psyche was scoured by fire.” Athena said watching as the roc began flying over her part of the forest, “My ability to empathize was not spared, you should be glad that you </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T417">can</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T465"> still care about them.” </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P301">An enormous black pillar rose from the ground in front of the roc as it rose the tip split open into five parts. The top formed into the basic shape of a hand right before the pillar violently contracted. The hand shot straight up, hit the roc, and kept going knocking the bird higher before closing around it. It looked like a stretched elastic band and soon the hand was rocketing back down with a screeching roc. Right before it hit the ground the hand changed to red. A loud splash resounded through the forest as a geyser of red liquid briefly appeared over the treetops. A flock of birds emerge from the surrounding area flying in every direction. One of them landed near the top of the tree near the Athena.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P194">“<text:span text:style-name="T466">Eventually they will learn to heed the warnings. Ponies too. Once you enter that forest, the rules from civilization end. The part I claimed is the only one not actively try to kill you.” Athena said, “I&apos;m not going to stop anyone from entering the wilderness, but it will kill you if you aren&apos;t careful.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P194">“<text:span text:style-name="T467">You&apos;re trying to make excuses?!” Shining hissed through his teeth.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P194">“<text:span text:style-name="T467">No, just explain. Maybe someone can avoid the same fate by learning from it. Although, if it&apos;s any consolation Sargent Iron Buckler will be remembered for as long as I live. I can&apos;t forget, no matter how much I might want to.” Athena said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P194">“<text:span text:style-name="T468">That&apos;s the best I&apos;m going to get isn&apos;t it?” Shining sighed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P194">“<text:span text:style-name="T468">The only other thing I can give you is a replica of his body, but I doubt that would do much. His armor is still where it was left, too.” Athena said noticing an approaching pony, “Your sister is coming so one last thing. Don&apos;t hold on to hate, it will destroy everything if left to fester.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P195">Shining narrowed his eyes with an impassive expression as he asked, “You know this from personal experience?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P195">“Yes, I was captured and tortured.” Athena said receiving a gasp from Twilight who had rejoined the group, “That was when I got the name of an ancient goddess of war and wisdom. That&apos;s also the reason why I have pyrophobia. It turns out that accelerated healing just means that you can be burned for longer and the nerves come back sooner.” Athena put on her poker face literally disconnecting her emotion from her expression at that point and continued, “Naturally I hated the ones who captured me, <text:soft-page-break/>I hated them with every fiber being. Every fiber burned with rage, until only ash was left. Complete apathy is not a state you want to experience, and the only reason I survived it was that I was not allowed to die. They weren&apos;t done with me, after all.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P195">A small splash drew the attention of all three to the ground where a drop of red goo was sinking into the ground. Looking at her hand Athena saw that her body was beginning to destabilize and appeared to melt. “I guess I&apos;ve regained some emotions.” she said as slowly moving waves appeared on her body. “There&apos;s a door under a tree along the border that leads to my house.” She said and pointed but more large red drops fell off of her arm <text:span text:style-name="T469">as her toga turned crimson. “Feel free to visit, but I won&apos;t be much company today. I don&apos;t usually use raw biomass for a body” she continued and looked down to see that her feet were covered with a puddle of goo and her body was an smooth red mass. “Turns out I can&apos;t keep it stable under emotional distress. Just another reason I don&apos;t like using it.” she said with a warble in her voice and let the rest of body collapse into a puddle. The two ponies could just stare at the surreal event as they watched the puddle continue sinking into the ground until it disappeared completely.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P195">At home her pony body was still connected and broadcasting everything. She was gently pulled into someone&apos;s forelegs as she shook and cried. The rest of the ponies left the two as Wild&apos;s emotional barriers fell. This was the first time she would actually afford to let them out and there were plenty built up. Eventually Rose took her upstairs to her room and stayed <text:span text:style-name="T469">with her</text:span> until she fell asleep.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P196">By the evening Wild was feeling better and moving around once again. <text:span text:style-name="T13">This is the first time in two years that I have been able to worry about anything other than survival, </text:span>she thought, <text:span text:style-name="T63">how do I do that? What do normal ponies worry about? </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T470">Considering the thought she remembered that people usually had goals and aspiration that drove them. She had been driven almost entirely by instinct until now so she had to figure out a goal. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T64">I... I want to be someones shield, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T471">she realized, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T65">I want to be mom&apos;s shield. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T472">Now certain, she went to find Rose Garden.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">It did not take long, Rose was in her office going over some paper work. Wild nervously shuffled in the door way causing Rose to look up at her through a pair of reading glasses. “Are you feeling better?” she asked getting a nod from Wild, “You still look troubled though. What&apos;s the matter?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">“Uh, well I did some thinking, and I figured out what I want.” Wild gulped, “Can I be your daughter?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">“Except in paperwork, you already are.” Rose said, “There&apos;s something else isn&apos;t there, you wouldn&apos;t be this nervous otherwise.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">“I already lost one set of parents, we were all infected together not long after the initial outbreak. I was the only one to come out of it with an intact mind, a cruel twist of fate. I survive the virus in a sense only to be faced with horrible caricatures of my parents.” Wild said with a mirthless chuckle, “I was torn apart by them before they left me for dead. I know they only looked like my parents, but I can&apos;t... I want to be your shield. I want to protect you so that nothing like that can happen.” Wild said before pulling out a small white ball and placing it on the desk, “I&apos;m a tool of war whether I like it or not, but I don&apos;t have to be a sword. That is a small piece of me, if you eat it I can keep you free of disease, heal faster, maybe even improve some things. I understand if you don&apos;t want it, but I would be <text:soft-page-break/>pleased if you let me do this for you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">It felt like hours before either moved, Rose staring impassive at the sphere, and Wild watching Rose hopefully. Finally Rose picked it up, stared for a second more, and quickly down the thing. It dissolved immediately and disappeared not even leaving a taste once it hit Rose&apos;s tongue. A horde of viral clones of white blood cells spread throughout her body repairing minor wear and tear as they went. Rose&apos;s eyes widened in surprise as she felt the subtle changes removing aches she had forgotten about and even some damage she thought permanent.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">“Thank you” Wild sighed relieved that Rose allowed her to help. She also felt herself shifting a little and looked at her flank. An image of the shield she used as Athena was appearing. This one however had a double helix as its border and a biohazard symbol in the center. A watermark of a light blue owl symbol was present behind the biohazard sign. An identical mark was carved into the the tree above her house. “That&apos;s going to be awkward to explain.” Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">Rose blinked and burst into laughter before she said, “You are like a kitten, always getting into the most ridiculous situations. <text:span text:style-name="T498">Y</text:span>ou got a cutie mark, <text:span text:style-name="T498">and at some point you got</text:span> a soul too.” Wild just blinked with her mouth hanging open. After a moment Rose added, “I think the ambient magic is adapting to you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">“Oh no, if its interacting with me then my virus is adapting to it too.” Wild groaned, “I have no idea what&apos;s going to come out of that. How am I going to explain having aegis on my butt, and its going to follow me in all my forms.” She let her head fall against the side of the desk. She tried shifting the mark away, but heat began to build up as soon as she started. “And it copied my geas to enforce itself.” she whined and bang her head on the desk.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P197">“Well that pretty much kills any chance of secrecy. <text:span text:style-name="T473">Let&apos;s see about getting ahead of this, then. I&apos;ll call an emergency meeting with some local allies for later tonight.” Rose said, “We&apos;ll present you to them and go from there.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P198">Wild wanted to check out the bog on the other side of her from Ponyville. The last roc she consumed had noticed some activity by a large creature like footprints and other leavings. It never actually saw the creature <text:span text:style-name="T474">since there was better hunting elsewhere. She sent her new owl body from earlier today to the bog as a scout. Flying made short work of the journey and she was soon settling on a tree to observe.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199">No large monster present, but there was a strange patch of land. A roughly square patch of land the size of a house looked packed down much more than the surrounding. There was also a shimmer in the air and a few old metal trinkets laying on the ground. The most confusing was that Wild&apos;s sonar was telling her that something was there, but not completely solid. There was only one reasonable course of action. Hit it with a stick from a distance. The stick sunk into something and began dissolving. In a couple minutes it was gone telling Wild all she needed to know. She promptly moved to a further tree and shifted herself to blend in with trunk before settling in to wait for the monster.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199">Her errand complete she found herself waiting for this meeting in the office. The <text:span text:style-name="T475">first arrival was a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T475">mint unicorn with a cyan mane that had a white stripe in it. When she entered she chirped, “So what did you find this time, Rosy?” Rose smirked and indicated the corner that Wild was occupying. “Oh, I&apos;m Lyra <text:s/>I remember you, Wild Way, right?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P199">“<text:span text:style-name="T476">Yes,” Wild answered, “How do you like my cutie mark?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">Lyra opened her mouth to respond, but stopped when she actually looked at the mark. “<text:span text:style-name="T477">Rose, what did you do?” Lyra asked keeping Wild within sight.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T477">She adopted a precocious filly, silly.” answered a voice from the ceiling. Pinkie was currently hanging from a set of suction cups on her hooves looking down at the rest of the rooms occupants.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T477">You weren&apos;t there a moment ago.” Wild yelped, “How are you able to teleport?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T477">Pinkie does that, but she is right” Rose said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T478">But young filly, how? And just plucking a roc out of the sky.” Lyra stammered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T478">This is my real age believe it or not. Although as a human I would just barely be an adult.” Wild said, “As for the roc, well I don&apos;t have a lot of ways to reach aerial targets so I had to use something big. Down side of weighing half a gigatonne.” Lyra was too busy fish mouthing to respond to that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T478">Well, it&apos;s about time to head to the meeting area. Are you still with us Lyra?” Rose asked as she made for the back door.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T478">Half a gigatonne.” Lyra said following, “A half gigatonne monster is sitting right outside Ponyville.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T479">One that finds Ponyville fine the way it is and has a geas to prevent starting fights.” Wild said from behind Lyra.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T479">Wait really. Ha, I knew you weren&apos;t kidnapping ponies, take that Bon Bon.” Lyra said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T479">Shining Armor mentioned that, too. What&apos;s this about missing ponies and who&apos;s Bon Bon?” Wild asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T479">That&apos;s the odd thing nearly half a dozen have disappeared without a trace. A couple look like they just skipped town, but the rest left everything behind clothes, food sometimes cooked.” Lyra said as she put on a cloak that she had left at the door. Rose opened a hidden door in what should have been an exterior wall.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T479">So lured and/or ambushed then.” Wild said, “So two rocs, a giant acid jelly cube, an amorphous blob, something that makes giant poops and a mysterious kidnapper. Does this town often get this kind of traffic?” Wild followed the other two down a long set of stairs and said, “I didn&apos;t know there was a secret room.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T480">Not this many at once usually, but where did you find a gelatinous cube? And giant poops really?” Lyra asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T481">The bog for both. The roc I got the memories from wasn&apos;t interested in that area for hunting, one </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T481">look at the poop as enough to dissuade it.” Wild explained now in a tunnel at the bottom of the stairs, “As for the cube, after the stick I threw at the jelly dissolved I was done with that thing. It was just kinda sitting there, the only reason I even noticed it is because I use sound instead of sight most of the time.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T481">Alright, we&apos;re almost there, ladies. It&apos;s time to dress up, are you going to be fine with me changing, dear?” Rose asked Wild and got a nod. This time Wild just backed up instead of trying to hide as the pink flames washed over Rose. She did not even need to close her eyes this time. “Lyra, you already have yours.” Rose said to Lyra who had put on her cloak that fully covered her head. “And you should change into Athena again.” Rose said. Wild did so but with a few changes. She was a centimeter shorter to fit in the tunnel. Her shield was on her back with no visible means of attachment and modified to match her cutie mark.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T481">OK, you are a lot more intimidating up close.” Lyra gulped.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P201">“<text:span text:style-name="T481">Wish I knew ponies found this more intimidating than a scruffy vagabond. Maybe that Sargent would have listened before I killed him.” Athena said continuing a few steps before noticing that the others stop. “I forgot to mention that before, didn&apos;t I?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P200">“<text:span text:style-name="T482">Yes,” Rose sighed, “an explanation would be a good idea right now.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P201">“<text:span text:style-name="T482">He thought he could disable or even kill me by lighting me on fire. So, I stopped protecting him and touched him.” Athena whined, “Fire hurts me as much as it would for a pony.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202">Rose winced at the explanation, “I wish you handled that better, but I probably would have done similar.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202">“But you can&apos;t be lit on fire.” Lyra pointed out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202">“For something else that painful, then.” Rose deadpanned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202">“You&apos;re fireproof.” Athena gasp with big doe eyes, “how does that work?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202">“Changeling chitin resists any attempt to transform it unless its by someone from the same hive. That includes chemical reactions like fire and acid.” Rose explained and Athena pulled a piece of chitin <text:s/>from the fold of her toga. They began moving again and Lyra sidled up to Rose.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202">“This is not how I would have thought the fearsome monster of the forest would act.” Lyra whispered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202">“Her mind has been ground down to a fine powder and she tries to arrange it as a normal filly. She&apos;s done a pretty good job of it from what I have heard of her past. Unfortunately, if you push too hard you can break through the facade. It won&apos;t cause any permanent damage, but then nothing will be protecting you from the sleeping giant on the other side.” Rose whispered back, “Also, I don&apos;t know why we are whispering she can still hear us clearly.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P202">“That&apos;s true.” Athena said from behind causing Lyra&apos;s hackles to raise, “Also, the first one to end up like me is an omnicidal psychopath, so I&apos;ve done a great job compared to that. Still weird that I was <text:soft-page-break/>always considered the most dangerous of the three, though.” Athena continued as she walked into an underground chamber. <text:span text:style-name="T483">The walls were made of the same hardened dirt as the tunnel entrance and the room was big enough to house a few dozen ponies comfortably. Along one side of the room was a raised pool of water with a wall of water behind it. Since Athena could not detect a solid wall holding the water back so she assumed it was kept in place by magic.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203">In the middle of the room were two ponies. One resembled a brown earth pony but <text:span text:style-name="T484">had the thickest fur that Athena had seen on a pony. He was also missing his hooves and had paws in there place and a little black nose on the end of his snoot. The other was almost a standard black maned gray pony, but he had a set of fangs and leathery wings instead of the normal feathered ones of pegasi. “Well I see the great Queen Formica has tamed the beast.” the brown stallion snorted seeing the new ponies coming up. The mare rolled their eyes, but Athena just observed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203">“<text:span text:style-name="T484">A pleasure as always, Diomedes.” Rose responded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203">“<text:span text:style-name="T484">I got a bone to pick with this one.” Diomedes said as he marched up to Athena. Athena hearing that reached into her toga and exchanged the chitin piece for four bones held in the gaps of her fingers.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203">“<text:span text:style-name="T484">Well, if all you wanted was bone you juts had to ask.” Athena said causing Diomedes to stop and blink when she held the bones out to him. He took one and bit it after inspecting it. The other stallion burst out into laughter as Athena put the rest of the bones away.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203">“<text:span text:style-name="T484">Oi, what are you laughing at?” Diomedes shouted, “and the hell kind of bone is this?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203">“<text:span text:style-name="T484">Unicorn, though its just a stereotypical bone shape, not one from an actual skeleton.” Athena answered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203">“<text:span text:style-name="T484">How did you manage to get unicorn bone?” the gray stallion questioned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203">“<text:span text:style-name="T484">Cloning,” Athena answered and created a miniature version of her pony body in her hand. “Tada, a mostly functional tiny pony.” Athena said and lowered her hand to show the tiny pony walking around.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P203">“<text:span text:style-name="T485">Oh now that is fascinating. I&apos;m Balanced Humors, or Doctor Blood Sample above ground...” He said now looking at the mini pony that had jumped to his hoof. The two soon engrossed themselves in a conversation about the Equestrian medical field.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">Lyra and Rose just watched as <text:span text:style-name="T487">the stallions were derailed by Athena</text:span>. They did not wait long <text:span text:style-name="T487">before</text:span> Athena whipped around and said, “You teleported again. How are you doing that?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“How do you know she didn&apos;t teleport us? <text:span text:style-name="T487">Huh, miss smarty pants.</text:span>” Pinkie said from <text:span text:style-name="T487">near an entrance to the room</text:span>. She was gesturing to a second figure. Standing next to her was another woman that Athena recognized from her first day here.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“You won&apos;t be able to get a real answer from her.” the woman said with a side long glance at Pinkie, “I see that you have found a place and settled in... as nicely as could be expected. Even got a new name and became a bit <text:span text:style-name="T487">melodramatic</text:span>. You have been busy.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“Athena was becoming a better fit than Audrey even if Blackwatch was the one to give it to me, but <text:soft-page-break/>you never did tell me what your goal is.” Athena said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“You do make a good goddess of warfare. You&apos;re just missing one piece <text:span text:style-name="T487">puzzle</text:span>, Equestria goes <text:span text:style-name="T487">through a cycle of artificial peace followed by a rest period</text:span>.” Gaea explained, “Oh, and combining two different oaths in a magic rich environment was an interesting choice.” she continued. When Athena tried to reply Gaea added, “No, not the good kind of interesting.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">While Athena was busy muttering profanities Rose stepped up to ask, “Who exactly are you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“You would know me as the Earth Mother, but if your daughter is going with the name Athena then Gaea would be mine from the same mythos.” Gaea answered causing everyone except Athena to bow.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">Athena sighed seeing the bowing ponies and said, “I hope you don&apos;t expect me to bow.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“Oh, I would probably send you back if you did.” Gaea said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“You said you couldn&apos;t do that.” Athena glared, “Also, that last answer was too straight forward. You want me to break the cycle and <text:span text:style-name="T487">create conflict.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“<text:span text:style-name="T487">I lied, its not like I have a geas on me to tell the truth.” Gaea smirked. Athena did not let up on her glare. The others had stopped bowing and were watching with concern.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“<text:span text:style-name="T487">Why would you want to break the cycle? It sounds pretty nice.” Lyra asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“<text:span text:style-name="T487">Peace is an interim state, and the longer it last the more you have to pay when it ends.” Athena explained when Gaea motioned to her, “Whoever is causing that cycle is just making an extinction level disaster inevitable. There&apos;s always a bigger fish.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“<text:span text:style-name="T487">A bigger fish than you, yeah right. You just snatched a roc out of the air.” Lyra scoffed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“<text:span text:style-name="T487">Uh, no, I&apos;m not really very strong in comparison to an army.” Athena said, “On Earth I was considered dangerous because I had the novel idea of staying hidden. In terms of raw power I&apos;m kinda weak.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“<text:span text:style-name="T488">So if something else came to Equestria...” Rose mused, “Yes, I can see why too much peace would be a bad thing.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“<text:span text:style-name="T488">Something else...” Athena said and blanched along with the others. They all looked Gaea, but found only a pile of dirt.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“<text:span text:style-name="T488">She went home.” Pinkie chirped.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P213">“<text:span text:style-name="T488">That bitch.” Athena shouted and received a scolding from Rose.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P283" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 8</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P230">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">Every time I think I&apos;ve seen it all, then something like this happens.” Diomedes said while waving his partial bone. They were watching as the towering biped was being lectured by the comparatively smaller changeling queen.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P230"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T489">Should I be concerned by how much you are enjoying that bone?” Lyra asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P230">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">Probably not, unicorns are too skinny to be worth the eating.” Athena answered before Diomedes could open his mouth. Rose sighed and put a hoof to her head as the two rejoined the group.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P230">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">I don&apos;t know whether to feel relieved or insulted.” Lyra said as Diomedes chuckled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P230">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">Alright, now hopefully the distraction are done and we can get this back on track.” Rose said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P267">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">Is this about the captain of the royal guard showing up? And Twilight staying up way too late trying to figure out how Athena can make null stones?” Pinkie blurted.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P268">“Pretty much. Athena here has all of the subtlety or a train crash, and has managed to make it impossible for her to maintain separate identities.” Rose replied. Athena grabbed the shield off her back to show the others.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P267">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">I got a cutie mark somehow, and it extends to almost any form I take.” Athena said pointing to the new shield design.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P267">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">That&apos;s not the same as earlier today.” Diomedes said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P267">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">Why is there a biohazard symbol in the middle?” Doctor Blood asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P267">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">The one from earlier was based off of the Aegis, the shield used by the mythological Athena. The changes are to make it more representative of myself since I am a... viral gestalt.” Athena explained. “I think I like that description the best.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P267">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">What the hay does that mean?” Diomedes asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P267">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">A secret paramilitary group wanted to create a bioweapon and ended up creating the Blacklight virus. It was very effective except for an anomaly, sometimes it would merge with its host. An imprint of the hosts mind would take over control of the virus once it finished consuming the body.” Athena said, “I was the second one created. At the lowest level, I&apos;m a loose collection of individual cells with a consciousness spread across them. I can also control each one individually and change their genetics at will.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P267">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">In Equish?” Diomedes asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P267">“<text:span text:style-name="T489">I can turn into any living material I&apos;ve had contact with, as well as shape shift, and I&apos;m a walking zombie plague.” Athena said. Rose and Pinkie were the only one that was not at least a little pale at the revelation. “For what its worth the guard only knows that I can shape shift and control part of the Everfree forest. They are adamant about not believing that I literally am that stand of trees.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P268">Rose took over again, “Between that and the fact that she can pop null stones out like candy,” Athena pull three out between her fingers. Lyra and the doc backed up a bit from the sparking stones. Rose sighed, “Just like that. Anyway, the royal guard is not going to leave anytime soon, and they are already poking around the Garden. <text:span text:style-name="T490">As well, Equestria as a whole is under attack by some very dangerous creatures.</text:span>”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P268"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T490">The deer are riled up too. Seems somepony went an threatened them so they&apos;ve been poking around the forest near Ponyville.” Diomedes said looking at Athena who averted her eyes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P268">“<text:span text:style-name="T490">I attempted to be diplomatic.” Athena said, “I don&apos;t think I&apos;m well suited to diplomacy.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P268">“<text:span text:style-name="T490">Given all of that, I think it may be time to expand before my daughter manages to start a war.” Rose said causing Athena to smile, “I want to create an actual changeling hive in Ponyville.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P268">“<text:span text:style-name="T490">Oh, can I be the hive.” Athena asked, “A hive with skeletons and glowing skulls. Blood dripping off the walls. I could make a beautiful &apos;evil&apos; lair.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P269">“I&apos;ve never done a party in an evil lair before.” Pinkie said while the others just stared, “Cobwebs for decorations, and everything written in &apos;blood&apos;. It would be perfect for Nightmare Night.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P269">“Oh sweet Celestia, they&apos;re planning together. Rose fix it.” Lyra whined.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P269">“Alright you two, we are not making an evil lair.” Rose shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P269">“Well... what about an underground forest lair.” Athena asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P269">“<text:span text:style-name="T491">OK, you can make an underground forest hive.” Rose sighed and went over details for the new hive. She also went over Athena&apos;s offer of protection in case of emergency. The meeting was progressing smoothly until a pony wandered into Athena&apos;s Stand.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P270">Athena formed an eye to try and see why a pony would enter the forest so early in the morning. TO her surprise she found that the pony was not alone. The pony was an beige colored Earth mare with a two tone pink and blue mane. She had a cutie mark of three wrapped candies. In front of her was a glowing green ball floating a little above the ground heading deeper into the forest. Athena tried calling to the mare, but got no response whatsoever. “There seems to be an abduction in progress.” Athena said before describing the scene.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P270">“That&apos;s Bon Bon. You got to save her.” Lyra yelled. Athena had already used a tendril to grab the mare and pull her into a tree. She was put into a hollow ball of biomass to be ferried away underground to Athena&apos;s house. <text:span text:style-name="T492">Lyra ran off down the tunnel as soon as she was told. The doctor and Pinkie went their own way, but the other three followed after Lyra at a more modest pace. The last occupant of the room had curled up in a corner and gone dormant.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P271">Athena and Rose went to bed after shifting back to normal. Both Diomedes and Lyra were on their way to Athena&apos;s home although Lyra elected to rush into the forest instead of going through the hallway. Bon Bon<text:span text:style-name="T493">&apos;s vessel had stopped under the floor, merged and opened upward to release the angry mare. “I knew you were the one abducting ponies. Now, where are the others.” Bon Bon yelled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P271">“<text:span text:style-name="T493">I see why you think that, but this is a counter abduction, unless you wanted to follow that green glowy ball thing.” Athena said and stepped out of the wall. Another crossbow bolt was soon embedded in the center of her chest. “Good reaction time, straight through the heart too, but why are you wasting your bolts?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P271">“<text:span text:style-name="T493">Bu, how? That should have killed you.” Bon Bon asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P271"><text:soft-page-break/>“<text:span text:style-name="T493">Maybe you will be open minded. This,” Athena said and gestured to herself, “is just an avatar, a proxy or whatever you want to call it. My real body is an enormous blob buried beneath you with a bunch of tree like appendages sticking out.” The mare looked beneath her hooves before her eyes began darting around as she tried to back away from every surface. “Why don&apos;t you sit down and put your weapon away. There are others coming that are not as resistant to crossbows. I don&apos;t think you want to hurt Lyra after all.” Athena said taking a seat in an armchair. Bon Bon sighed and sat on the couch, but did not let the crossbow out of her grip.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P271">“<text:span text:style-name="T494">You said I was caught by a will-o-wisp?” Bon Bon asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P271">“<text:span text:style-name="T494">If that&apos;s what it&apos;s called then yes. What were you doing before it caught you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P271">“<text:span text:style-name="T494">Keeping away from the guards, then trying to follow a suspicious pony in a black cloak. Can&apos;t believe I got ensorcelled.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P272">Diomedes entered the room at that point. Bon Bon had lifted her weapon and grabbed a bolt by the time the door had fully opened. She aimed and pulled the trigger as soon as she confirmed that it was not a normal pony that entered. Athena just watched calmly as nothing happened since she had already seen it was not cocked. “Bit trigger happy there.” Athena said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P272">“<text:span text:style-name="T495">Eh, Bonnie lass has always been that way.” Diomedes said as he looked around.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P272">“<text:span text:style-name="T495">You said Lyra was coming.” Bon Bon hissed as she tried to rearm her weapon.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P272">“<text:span text:style-name="T495">She is, but I&apos;m getting the impression that navigation is not one of her strengths.” Athena said and pushed the crossbow back down to the couch, “Now, you don&apos;t need your weapon here.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P272">“<text:span text:style-name="T495">That&apos;s rich, you trap me in here with a monster and say I don&apos;t need weapons.” the mare scoffed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P273">Athena blinked and said, “None of the doors are locked, I&apos;m not stopping you from leaving. The one he came through leads to the edge of the forest, and the door Lyra&apos;s about to open leads directly outside.” Sure enough Lyra burst through the door and tackled Bon Bon not long after Athena finished speaking.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P273">“<text:span text:style-name="T496">Do I even want to know how you got a plumbing system out here?” Diomedes asked as he fiddled with the sink.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P273">“<text:span text:style-name="T496">Aquifer and bedrock deep enough for geothermal heating.” Athena answered as Bon Bon tried to remove the pony attached to her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P273">“<text:span text:style-name="T497">Lyra, why are you wearing the cloak?” Bon Bon asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P273">“<text:span text:style-name="T497">Um,” Lyra responded averting her eyes, “Why do you have a loaded crossbow, hmm?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P273">“<text:span text:style-name="T497">The Bonnie lass is a monster hunter.” Diomedes interjected while looking at something in his hoof, “Why do you have bollocks?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">Athena looked over to see him holding a fruit and laughed, “That&apos;s just a kiwifruit. I don&apos;t even know if its native to this world, but I know you can eat it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274"><text:soft-page-break/>“Weird,” he said after taking a bite, “Anyway, it&apos;s a good time to have a monster hunter around, if she can figure out which monsters to leave alone.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">“And let you hurt innocent ponies.” Bon Bon said, “No.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">“And yet the only reason you aren&apos;t eaten is because of an unrepentant monster.” Athena said, “Although I don&apos;t really target innocents or ponies so there that.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">“That would be more believable if you hadn&apos;t killed those guards.” Bon Bon sneered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">“I&apos;m a biologist, I didn&apos;t know there was that much power in a lightning strike, and the Sargent lit me on fire.” Athena countered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">“They&apos;re that powerful if you put that much magic in them, and the Sargent was protecting us, doing his duty.” Bon Bon said <text:span text:style-name="T498">with a glare</text:span>.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">“I have no magical ability, that was a natural strike.” Athena said, “As for the Sargent have you ever had your flesh seared off, its very painful. I told him what would happen, but that fool did it anyway. <text:span text:style-name="T498">T</text:span>he truth geas I have on me <text:span text:style-name="T498">means I can&apos;t make empty threats</text:span>.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">“<text:span text:style-name="T498">Bon Bon, how do you determine whether somepony is a threat or not?” Lyra asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">“<text:span text:style-name="T498">When a couple of monsters start fighting over Ponyville it&apos;s not hard to figure out.” Bon Bon said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">“<text:span text:style-name="T498">Well, that&apos;s pretty fair. The roc was looking for hunting ground, and I suppose it seemed like I was too. The truth is I&apos;ve never been a hunter. At this point I&apos;m more plant than animal so its not like I need to eat anything let alone ponies. Really, I wanted Ponyville because ponies are fun to have around.” Athena said. “Remember, truth geas.” she added when Bon Bon tried to reply.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P274">“<text:span text:style-name="T498">Alright, fine. I guess I can see where this goes, but I still don&apos;t trust you.” Bon Bon conceded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P275">The mares ended up sleeping there for the little bit of the night still left while Diomedes headed back to his cave in the whitetail woods. He was going to move into the house, but first needed to tell the mares he lived with of the new plan. Even if this place was in the Everfree forest it was still a huge improvement even in terms of safety with Athena around. Athena was just happy to have guests over.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="Heading_20_1" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 9</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P231"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T375">The rest of the day was spent lounging around town after the recent events for Wild. <text:s/>During the night she decided to go on another walk through the forest to see what she could find. <text:s/>She would welcome another manticore, but her real target was much smaller. <text:s/>She was looking for a spider to explore the possibilities of spider silk. She did manage to find a few species of spiders after hours of looking, but not much else since she stayed near to the edge of the forest.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P231"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T375">Now that she had a good collection of spider genes it was time to experiment. <text:s/>In this case that amounted to creating a huge mess with globs and filaments of spider webbing covering herself and much of the surrounding flora. <text:s/>Her persistence payed off as she figured out how to consistently make silk fibers without sticking parts of the forest to her body. <text:s/>Working from there she tried adding more </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T375">spinnerets rather than making them larger and succeeded in making strands large enough to support her weight. <text:s/>She considered the possible marketing opportunities, but first she had much more important business.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P231"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T375">While she was experimenting an observer had shown up hiding in a tree. <text:s/>The darkness and leaf cover did next to nothing in blocking Wild&apos;s sonar. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T41">This is getting ridiculous, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T190">she fumed, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T41">can&apos;t a girl get some privacy. <text:s/>At least I&apos;m not subjected to most biologically needs or I would really be pissed. Heh. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T190">One more practice session and her plans were complete. <text:s/>She could now launch her ropes, meaning there was only one reasonable course of action.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P231"><text:span text:style-name="T190"><text:tab/>“Spidermare. <text:s/>Spidermare, doing whatever a Spidermare can.” <text:s/>She sang </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T191">as she swung from branch to branch sing her spider silk as a grapple. <text:s/>Her spectator did not follow either because of her speed, shear surprise at her actions, or scare at the fact she had run into several trees. <text:s/>The trees were obliterated before being consumed in an unintentional display of raw power. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T192">Approaching the tree line she built up as much speed as she could and swung up into the air. <text:s/>Reaching a height well above the canopy when she launched out of the forest she went into a series somersaults. <text:s/>She stuck the landing with a shower dirt and loud ground shaking thud. <text:s/>Of course, had she been anyone else landing on her head with that much force would have been a lot worse. <text:s/>Wild walked away with just a headache and the knowledge that her enthusiasm outpaced her skills in gymnastics.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P118"><text:tab/>Walking through town was a little tense. <text:s/>None of the ponies did anything overt, but a few would watch Wild longer than necessary, particularly when foals were around. <text:s/>There was also a conspicuous bubble around her that ponies would either avoid or hurry out of. <text:s/>Annoyed, she decided that the best solution would be exposure therapy and parked herself in the middle of the town square. <text:s/>The towns ponies would either get used to her, or just have to avoid the middle of town forever. <text:s/>That plan lasted until Lyra showed up to bring Wild to her first club meeting.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P118"><text:tab/>The club meeting was held in town hall and a couple dozen ponies already present when the pair walked in. <text:s/>Lyra got a few greetings, but Wild ended up with the most attention. <text:s/>In contrast to the general population, the ponies here were eager to meet her and swarmed around in a cacophony of greetings. <text:s/>Lyra had made her way to the front of the room to stand on a stage. <text:s/>Once enough time had passed she called for attention and all of the ponies found their way to a palce in front of the stage.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T192"><text:tab/>“Welcome </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T193">fellow Conspiracy Hunters</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T192">, let&apos;s get this meeting started. <text:s/>We have some </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T193">urgent new developments which is why I called this emergency meeting. <text:s/>First though we have a new member with us today. <text:s/>She&apos;s even the source of the developments. <text:s/>Everyone welcome Wild Way, our brand new resident alien shape shifter.” Lyra pontificated clearly enjoying being a ham. <text:s/>Wild stood up at that and waved to the crowd. <text:s/>There was a decent amount of clapping and greetings, but the one that Wild noticed the most were the smiles on the ponies faces. <text:s/>They were clearly excited for this new development, and not even remotely worried about her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P119"><text:tab/>Wild was having a surprisingly hard time grasping the concept that these ponies knew what she was, but were not freaking out. <text:s/>She even ventured, “None of you look worried about me.” She faltered, “I...”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>Seeing the beginning of tears the nearest mare to Wild drew her into a hug, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T194">rather impressive since Wild weighed at least twice as much as the mare. <text:s/>“Come here dear, you&apos;re among friends.” the mare cooed. <text:s text:c="2"/>Every time Wild tried to protest the mare just silenced her until Wild gave in a relaxed into the hug. <text:s/>“It doesn&apos;t matter what you are here, everyone here is capable of terrible things. <text:s/>We are all well aware that just because you can do something doesn&apos;t mean you will.” <text:s/>Wild just cried on the mare&apos;s shoulder as she realized that maybe her tribulations would end.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P120"><text:tab/>Breaking the hug, and wiping her face Wild croaked, “I guess after spending years in a war zone, sometimes I forget that there can be nice people.” <text:s/>That concept surprised the entire room, war happens occasionally, but there had not been a war lasting years in centuries.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P120"><text:tab/>One curious stallion asked, “What were they fighting over for so long?” <text:s/>He received a few glares for that and shrunk back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T194"><text:tab/>Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T210">gave a humourless</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T194"> chuckled, “The world I come from is much more violent from what I&apos;ve seen, the conflict only spanned a fifth of the city it was in. <text:s/>As for the reasons, it was two groups of monsters fighting. <text:s/>One wanted to remake everyone in their own image. <text:s/>The process they used was much less pleasant than that sounds. <text:s/>The other group wanted to cover up the whole thing, and also had a penchant for doing experiments on civilians stuck in the area. <text:s/>They really didn&apos;t want it known that they had created the first group and lost control of it.” <text:s/>Conversation died down after that allowing Lyra to retake control of the meeting.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T194"><text:tab/>“The next order of business, unfortunately is the confirmation of our worst suspicions. <text:s/>The </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T222">Bulwark</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T194"> are targeting Wild Way to point that they risked the lives of towns ponies that happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. <text:s/>Thank Wild for your quick thinking, that attack could have been much worse.” <text:s/>Lyra lamented taking a moment before continuing, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T195">As well there has been a cases of spying, stabbing, and possibly weaponized lightning. <text:s/>The only reason this hasn&apos;t been a case of murder, is because Wild Way is nigh immortal.” <text:s/>Wild shrugged and confirmed it, not much short of complete cellular death would actually kill her. <text:s/>Lyra asserted, “This is not acceptable, we need to do something. <text:s/>I think it is time to start working a plan to reveal ourselves. <text:s/>I have the least risk though, so what do all of you think?” <text:s/>Murmurs spread throughout the crowd, until the mare sitting next to Wild offered her support. <text:s/>Even though her support was tentative it still got gasp from many of the ponies.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T195"><text:tab/>“It is quite an exciting time, but the actions against Wild Way prove at least one thing beyond a doubt. <text:s/>The </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T222">Frozen Bulwark</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T195"> are not something we can play around with, and there will be no second chances with them in any sens of the phrase.” <text:s/>the mare proclaimed. <text:s/>Now that she was not crying Wild got a good look at the mare. <text:s/>She had a coat a shade lighter green than Wild&apos;s, but her mane was much more distinctive. <text:s/>It was braided all the way down her neck, thin streaks of white hair running through the vibrant red that made up the bulk. <text:s/>The distinct lines on her face were the only hint of age, otherwise she appeared as a mare in her prime. <text:s/>Her flank was adorned by a single rose bud. <text:s/>The mare continued speaking, “We cannot afford to be discovered by them, but we cannot simply stay the course and hope that we don&apos;t get revealed. <text:s/>Instead, we need to reveal our selves on our own terms.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P121"><text:tab/>The crowd started debating the issue but it was clear they would not reach an agreement. <text:s/>This <text:soft-page-break/>was more to brainstorm ideas than to come up with a ready to go plan anyway. <text:s/>Wild waited for them to agree to disagree before she asked, “Hey, I know what species Lyra is, but what about everyone else?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T195"><text:tab/>“We forgot to do the introductions.” Lyra groaned, “You have already met our resident blood sucker, Doctor Humor the vampire.” <text:s/>He stood and bowed. “The wolfpony twins Shepherd and Collie </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T196">run a pet shop in town.” <text:s/>a mare and stallion waved. <text:s/>“And everyone else is a love bug with Rose as the Ponyville changeling queen.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P122"><text:tab/>“What&apos;s a changeling?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P122"><text:tab/>Instead of Lyra the mare next to Wild, Rose spoke up, “We are a race of shape shifter that consume love. <text:s/>While being more or less ponies, we do have many insectoid traits. <text:s/>Lyra has decided that we are love bugs because of this.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T196"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T197">How does one consume love?” Wild asked perplexed by the concept.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P123"><text:tab/>“Technically the love is a catalyst for siphoning energy, but saying we eat love is easier.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T377">What does an insectoid pony look like anyway?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T377">Well, I&apos;ll show you mine if you show me yours.” Rose grinned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T377">I... Alright, I can show you a larger version of what I originally looked like.” Wild spluttered at the innuendo. <text:s/>She reared up and let a swarm of black tendrils break down her pony form. <text:s/>Within just a few seconds a 7 foot tall woman appeared with the muscular build of an amazon. <text:s/>She even made a pair of jeans and green shirt that looked brand new. <text:s/>A pack was slung across her shoulder since saddle bags would not work for a human. <text:s/>Her hair stretched half way down her back this time and she absently ran her fingers through it. <text:s/>“Huh, I forgot how nice fingers are.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T378">I did not expect you to be bipedal. <text:s/>You are quite pretty as you are though, but where did the clothes come from?” <text:s/>Rose admired as she and the rest of the ponies came closer to get a good look.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T378">Part of the shape shifting, they are actually made from modified hair essentially.” <text:s/>Wild explained before removing her bag, “Fully detachable too.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T378">That is an impressive ability,” Rose admitted, “My turn then.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T378">Wait, don&apos;t...” Lyra tried to warn just now remembering how changeling transformation worked. <text:s/>Unfortunately she was too late and Rose burst in to green flames. <text:s/>They burned away her current form, and left just as quickly to reveal a large black form. <text:s/>Rose still had the basic equine shape, but was covered in black chitin instead of fur. <text:s/>Circling her torso was a green band, and her back had a pink saddle shaped plate on it. <text:s/>Her mane was also pink and a long horn jutted out from the center of her forehead. <text:s/>The biggest change was her height, she was about twice the height of a pony and reached Wild&apos;s current height with the tip of her horn. <text:s/>On top of her head was a trio of antennae that resembled a crown.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T379">Wild was still caught up in the fiery display. <text:s/>Seeing someone else burst into flames managed to confuse her phobia since she was equally afraid of losing someone to fire as she was of the fire itself. <text:s/></text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T379">In the end the fire was completely gone before she could reach a decision on how to act. <text:s/>Her first action after seeing a blackened figure that was just aflame was to immediately grab Rose and inspect the damage going so far as to lift her from the ground. <text:s/>“You&apos;re not burnt?” she hesitated now seeing that Rose was covered in chitin and not charred, “but you were just on fire.” <text:s/>Wild was frozen trying to figure out this puzzle.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T379">I forgot that she was deathly afraid of fire.” Lyra confessed to Rose.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T379">Well, this is a strange predicament but I&apos;ve been in worse.” Rose replied from her position in Wild&apos;s hands, “She certainly is a strong one though. <text:s/>Not many could just casually pick up a changeling queen.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T379">Wild brain had finished processing and reached the conclusion that she had an unharmed and adorable new creature. <text:s/>She drew the changeling into a hug and cooed, “You&apos;re adorable.” <text:s/>Everyone one in the room stopped as they tried to understand the alien in their midst, particularly the disguised changelings that had moved to rescue their queen.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T379">I think that is the first time anyone has described us as adorable,” Rose perplexed, “but could you let me down, this is a bit of an awkward position.” <text:s/>Wild did so and blushed after reviewing her recent actions.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T379">&apos;m Sorry, I got caught up in the moment” Wild apologized, “but how are you not burned at all.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T379">Changelings are immune to fire, and other chemical reactions for that matter. <text:s/>Their magic prevents them from being forcefully transformed, which includes such reactions.” Lyra lectured.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T379">You&apos;re immune to fire, too.” <text:s/>Wild beamed eyes sparkling in her admiration, “Changelings are awesome.” <text:s/>As if worried that speaking to loud would break something Wild whispered, “What about detached pieces of chitin, are those fireproof?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T380">Head tilted to the side Rose answered, “I don&apos;t actually know, it&apos;s never been tested before.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T380">Undeterred Wild continued, “Can we try, I can make a piece? <text:s/>I just need a DNA sample.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T380">You are strangely obsessed with this,” Rose relented, “but now I&apos;m curious too. <text:s/>What does it take for a DNA sample?” <text:s/>Wild explained the process and gave Rose one of the water canteens from her bag. <text:s/>Rose rinsed with it, and spit the water back in before returning it. <text:s/>A few seconds after replacing the canteen, Wild pulled a small sheet of chitin out to the surprise of her spectators. <text:s/>Rose marveled, “I am slightly surprised that worked. <text:s/>I can&apos;t help but wonder what one of the Canterlot Universities would make of this.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T380">Wild had already hidden in on a second floor balcony just peeking over the edge. <text:s/>Lyra was able to provide the needed fire for the test. <text:s/>It turned out that the chitin was not immune to fire like it would be on a changeling, but it held up until rock melting temperatures. <text:s/>That was good enough for Wild, and changeling chitin became her single favorite material. <text:s/>Wild and Rose returned to their normal forms, though Wild used a changeling variant for fur and hair. <text:s/>The rest of ponies wandered off since the meeting was finished, but both Rose and Wild remained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T380">Wild have you given any thought to getting a house in Ponyville?” <text:s/>Rose inquired as the two mares trotted down the street.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T380">Not really, I couldn&apos;t afford to for so long I just forgot it was something I could do.” <text:s/>Wild explained with a growing smile, “Now that you brought it up it would be nice to have a place to call my own. <text:s/>I would have to build my own...” she gulped, “or it might be burned down.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T381">Well, I don&apos;t know if you are interested, but I actually have an available plot of land just inside the Everfree forest.” <text:s/>Rose offered, “Most ponies would not be even remotely interested in such a location, but I imagine it wouldn&apos;t be a problem for you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T381">It wouldn&apos;t.” Wild confirmed, but quirked an eyebrow as she challenged, “You have an ulterior motive though, why else would you just offer me something like that, or own land in the forest for that matter?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T381">True,” Rose said, “owned was perhaps not the right word. <text:s/>My group has special needs and as such needs a place to handle those. <text:s/>We are also somewhat secretive so the Everfree forest was our choice. <text:s/>Its reputation would keep the nosy away, and there is plenty of space as the entire thing is essentially unclaimed. <text:s/>However, the forest is dangerous, and with the recent activity our fighting ability leaves something to be desired. <text:s/>I was-”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T381">You want me to be a meat-shield for you.” Wild interrupted. <text:s text:c="2"/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T42">I should probably feel insulted by this, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T198">Wild wondered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T42">but it does present an opportunity. <text:s/>Not like its different from what I would be doing anyway.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T42"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T198">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T199">That&apos;s not how I would have said it,” Rose placated, “but yes...”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T199"><text:tab/>“Hmm” Wild drew out letting Rose linger in uncertainty. <text:s/>The pair had stopped at the edge of town and Wild even brought a hoof to her chin. <text:s/>She countered, “Alright, but on a few conditions. <text:s/>First, I will defer any legal, or political issues to you should they arise. <text:s/>Second, I want you to provide the building materials for me. <text:s/>And the last one is a bit strange.” <text:s/>Reaching into her bag Wild pulled out what appeared to be an ordinary rock </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T200">the size of a small cat</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T199"> and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T200">forced</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T199"> her face to remain emotionless </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T200">as she </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T199">said, “I want you to take care of my pet rock.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T199"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T200">Rose just blinked at those requests while Wild patiently waited. <text:s/>Eventually Rose collected wits and asked, “The first two I can understand where you are coming from, but why in the world would you need me to take care of a pet rock?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P124"><text:tab/>Wild grinned, “It&apos;s not actually a rock, though a pet rock is about what it amounts too for the most part. <text:s/>It&apos;s actually a backup plan or me, and is alive. <text:s/>All I need you to do with it is find some safe spot to keep it thats open the outside air. <text:s/>It does eat, but spores and dust from the air will be enough for it.” <text:s/>Seeing that Rose had tilted her head and had not responded Wild went on, “Well, should it be relevant I would need about 100 tons of organic matter for building material. <text:s/>Doesn&apos;t really matter where it comes from.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T200"><text:tab/>“You are one strange mare, but I can agree to those terms. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T201">Let me show you the spot.” Rose </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T201">agreed and took the &apos;pet rock&apos; from Wild before asking, “When you say organic matter does the state its in matter.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P232"><text:span text:style-name="T201"><text:tab/>“Nope, raw sewage would be fine, but I hope you don&apos;t have that much sewage just laying around.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T202">The two mares head off to see the location, it was not a far walk as it was the closest section of the forest to the the edge of town. <text:s/>No sense in making it a longer walk than necessary especially when you are trying to be sneaky. <text:s/>The plot itself was a completely generic area of moderate forest on starting on the border and stretching a half mile into the forest. <text:s/>The sole interesting feature was a camouflaged tunnel half way down one of the edges. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T203">Wild was ready to begin her foray into interior design.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P289" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 10</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T382">Wild and Rose stood just outside the hidden tunnel when Wild grinned, “Alright time to see some of what I can do.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T382">What do you mean?” asked Rose but Wild was walking over to a tree nearby tree. <text:s/>When she reached it Wild placed a hoof on its surface, and closed her eyes. <text:s/>She would need a lot of concentration for this to prevent any unfortunate accidents. <text:s/>Soon a ring of black tendrils erupted from the tree&apos;s bark around the hoof slowly expanding in a ring. <text:s/>Once it wrapped around the entire trunk the now two rings speed up running up and down the height of the tree. <text:s/>Strangely everywhere the tendrils passed looked exactly as it had before. <text:s/>Another ring would split off for every branch passed and every leaf would appear to erupt in black flame as the tendrils consumed it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T383">Rose was fascinated by the process as the tree was consumed and an exact replica left behind. <text:s/>Seeing the last of the visible tendrils disappear she expected Wild to come out of her trance soon. <text:s/>Rose was confused when that was not the case until new rings of tendrils appeared at the base of the two closest trees. <text:s/>The process repeat itself faster this time and again there was a period of seeming inactivity. <text:s/>Half a dozen trees this time started being consumed in pattern spreading away from the tunnel. <text:s/>Figuring that the pattern would continue she transformed back to her changeling form and watched from the air. <text:s/>Rose just hang in the air above the canopy watching as a black wave spread through the forest.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T384">By the Earth Mother, she is like a forest fire.” Rose whispered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T385">Oh no, she is much more than that.” <text:s/>a mare said next Rose startling the changeling. <text:s/>Casually standing on thin air was a huge Earth pony mare. <text:s/>She was easily a match for Rose in terms of height. <text:s/>Her coat and Mane were both an earthy brown color, but her mane transitioned into vines as it near her body. <text:s/>The vines spread out across her in a thick webbing. <text:s/>Half of them were a vibrant green while the other half were black with wicked looking thorns. <text:s/>Both types covered her entire body running over and under at random and even ran the length of her tail binding it into a thick cord. <text:s/>The mare continued, “She is my latest experiment, and the most dangerous one by far. <text:s/>We are heading into some exciting times.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T385">You&apos;re the one who brought her?” Rose muttered, “Taking her from her world seems rather cruel.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T385">The mare chuckled, “I thought you knew me better than that, Formica. <text:s/>You know that I can be a cruel mistress.” <text:s/>The turned her attention back to Wild&apos;s work prompting Rose to do the same before adding, “Although in this case leaving her alone would have been more cruel. <text:s/>You already realize how terrifying what she&apos;s doing is, but this is controlled. <text:s/>Just imagine what would happen if instead of trees she did this to your changelings starting in the middle of your hive. <text:s/>It looks like nothing has happened down there because she is taking care to minimize the impact. <text:s/>If she wasn&apos;t doing that each of those trees would end up riddled with tumors and raw flesh spilling across the ground.” <text:s/>Looking Rose in the eyes the mystery mare concluded, “That is would be just the beginning of what she experienced.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T386">I go by Rose now, but just have you brought to Equestria, Earth Mother?” Rose demanded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T386">A catalyst.” the Earth Mother replied then turned back to the forest and commented, “Fascinating, leave it to a human to find a way to clear cut part of a forest without disturbing the local ecosystem.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T387">What are you talking about, the forest looks fine.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T387">It only looks fine, for that matter it only looks like a forest too. <text:s/>There isn&apos;t a single tree left down there.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T387">When Rose turned to ask the Earth Mother about her words Rose found only empty space. <text:s/>She huffed and watched Wild work. <text:s/>The line on affected trees ended up tracing out a rough circle about two thirds of a mile squared. <text:s/>A band about half the width of the circle was also affect leading off to the edge of the forest. <text:s/>All told Wild had claimed an enormous section of land for her estate. <text:s/>The sun was getting ready to set by the time she was done.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T388">That was a lot more exhausting than I thought.” <text:s/>Wild breathed eyes drooping and posture slumped. <text:s/>While she was practically immune to physical exhaustion, the stress of managing the spread of her infection taxed her mental endurance more than anything before. <text:s/>However, she was successful every tree in her plot of land was converted without affecting any of the other flora or fauna.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T388">Oh hey, Rose your a lady bug again.” Wild giggled, “Can I crash on your couch?” <text:s/>She managed to make it a few steps toward Rose, but then tripped over her own hooves plopping on her side. <text:s/>Squinting Wild tried to figure out what happen and why she was laying down. <text:s/>Her conclusion was to try again after sleeping. <text:s/>Rose levitated the heap of earth pony onto her back as she set off for her hive. <text:s/>She was in agreement with Wild that some rest might help her make sense of all the recent chicanery.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T389">Rose felt something like a giant mass of squirming worms on her back for a second. <text:s/>When she checked to see what it was she found a tinier version of herself. <text:s/>Rose continued on and speculated, “Oh dear, we are in for a wild ride it seems.” <text:s/>Reaching one of the spare rooms Rose gently set Wild in a bed and left for her own bedroom. <text:s/>She did ask one of her nearby drones to notify her when Wild woke up. <text:s/>She did not pay attention when said drone referred to Wild as her daughter.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T389">When Wild woke up she felt better than she had in a long time, although she did not remember falling asleep in a bed. <text:s/>Looking around the room saw that it was rather spartan with only a bed, table, and lights. <text:s/>The walls and furniture were all made of some kind of hardened dirt cement type compound. <text:s/>The lights were some sort of bioluminescent bulbs on the wall. <text:s/>Figuring it was safe enough she took stock of herself.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T390">Concentrating on her sense Wild realized her awareness was massively expanded. <text:s/>She could vaguely sense the entire forest that she converted, and felt the suns rays on her leaves. <text:s/>They felt deliciously warm almost like eating pancakes hot off the stove. <text:s/>“Oh sweet, I&apos;m solar powered now!” she exclaimed before digging deeper. <text:s/>The wind was the next sensation she found, but it was the strange tapping feeling appearing in a multitude of locations. <text:s/>She could not figure out what it was and decided to pick one and see what it was. <text:s/>Closing her eyes, and growing a new set near the tapping she found a squirrel hopping along a branch. <text:s/>“Oh crap, I&apos;m going to be constantly feeling everything that moves.” <text:s/>she whimpered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T391">Rose walked into the room to find Wild with eyes unfocused, and frowning. <text:s/>“What has you so down, dear?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T391">I have made a horrible miscalculation.” <text:s/>Wild moaned after refocusing her eyes, “I can feel all of the animals, its like being poked incessantly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T392">So you really did decide to assimilate a square mile of forest.” Rose said massaging her brow with a hoof before scolding, “Child, you should have thought of that before you made yourself into a makeshift genius loci. <text:s/>You&apos;re just going to have to learn to deal with it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T392">I realize that now.” Wild whined planting her face on the floor, “on the bright side I have a decent map of the underground, and sunlight is delicious.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T392">What are you talking about now?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T392">I wanted to survey the land as well as claim it, so I made a vast web of roots from the trees. <text:s/>Also, consuming that many trees means I am, um...” Wild explained, “a photo-vore. <text:s/>That&apos;s probably not the right word.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P233"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T392">Huh, at least you got something out of that spectacle yesterday, but you have another situation to deal with. <text:s/>It seems your friends have noticed, and are coming to investigate,” Rose drawled before heading out of the room, “Come on, let&apos;s go.” <text:s/>Wild tried to protest, but Rose just grabbed Wild by the tail with magic and dragged her along. <text:s/>The tunnels they passed through were made of the same material as the bedroom complete with the glowing bulbs. <text:s/>It had a very organic feels as there were no right angles, just curves making the changeling hive labyrinthine. <text:s/>Along the way they encountered a group of changelings who addressed Wild as princess. <text:s/>Both Rose and Wild froze at that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P248"><text:tab/>Wild just noticed that she was a changeling and giggled awkwardly. <text:s/>“oops,” she squeaked, and changed back to her normal form. <text:s/>The other changelings decide it was a good time to find anywhere else to be as the tension escalated in the tunnel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P234"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T393">One problem at a time.” Rose reasoned and continued out of the hive. <text:s/>She also changed into her usual disguise before leaving. <text:s/>She was able to keep a hold on Wild when she panicked at the fiery display but not without sliding backward a couple feet even though she had braced herself. <text:s/>The walk through the forest itself was quiet since most of the nearby animals were still confused by Wild&apos;s take over. <text:s/>Wild now traveling under her own power decided to hum in an effort to ignore the infernal tapping.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P234"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T394">Rose and Wild exited the forest together not far from a trio of ponies. <text:s/>Rose had a frown on her face and Wild had her ears folded back and was now humming “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T204">taps”</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T43">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T204">Rose, Twilight, and Fluttershy were all giving her blank looks. <text:s/>The last pony was a blond maned orange earth pony mare with a brown stetson. <text:s/>The hatted pony was glaring at Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P234"><text:span text:style-name="T204"><text:tab/>“Really. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T205">You&apos;re just here for an explanation not an execution.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T204">” Rose </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T205">scolded and addressed other group, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T206">Fluttershy, Applejack, and Twilight I assume you</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T205"> are here because of last nights occurrences.” <text:s/>Receiving nods she pushed Wild up to them and said, “Well here&apos;s your explanation. <text:s/>Go on Wild dear.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P234"><text:span text:style-name="T205"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T206">Well... you see...” Wild stalled and gradually lowered her volume until inaudible.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P125"><text:tab/>“Well, spit it out already, what did you do in the Everfree last night?!” Applejack snarled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P234"><text:span text:style-name="T206"><text:tab/>“I consumed all of the trees in approximately one square mile of the forest.” Wild said staring at a spot on the ground </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T210">pointedly avoiding Applejack&apos;s eyes</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T206">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P125"><text:tab/>“YOU DID WHAT?!” Applejack yelled stomping up to Wild and tried to get into her face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P234"><text:span text:style-name="T206"><text:tab/>“I consumed all of the trees in approximately one square mile of the forest.” Wild repeated still staring at the same spot. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T207">The other tree ponies did not like where this conversation was going, but could only watch. <text:s/>Applejack did a half turn and cocked her legs for a buck in an instant. <text:s/>Wild however was able to catch her intention fast enough to drop to the ground before Applejack could complete her buck. <text:s/>When Applejack overextended herself took to the opening and stood back up causing Applejack to flip over onto her back.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P234"><text:span text:style-name="T207"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T209">Enough, both of you</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T207">!” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T208">Rose scolded, “I swear this town is full of children sometimes. <text:s/>You don&apos;t have to like each other, but you do have to remain civil.” <text:s/>Once Applejack returned to hooves Rose asked, “Now are you both calm?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P234"><text:span text:style-name="T208"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T209">Yes,” muttered Applejack.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:span text:style-name="T209"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T210">No,” said Wild causing everyone to turn their attention to her. <text:s/>She was still staring at the same spot, but now the ponies noticed her unfocused eyes. <text:s/>Rose went to try getting Wild&apos;s attention, but Wild shifted over a foot just before Rose&apos;s hoof could reach her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:span text:style-name="T210"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T211">Wild, we are all calming down.” Rose soothed recognizing the symptoms, “Can you do that with us?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P126"><text:tab/>“No.” Wild answered.<text:tab/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P126"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“Oh come on,” Applejack interrupted, “quit being difficult.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P126"><text:tab/>“Oh, um, Applejack you shouldn&apos;t be too hard on her.” Fluttershy pointed out, “If its alright with you let&apos;s go back to Ponyville.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:span text:style-name="T211"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T212">She&apos;s just trying to be difficult.” Applejack argued, “All she needs is some sense knocked into her.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P127"><text:tab/>“Applejack, she&apos;s having a panic attack.” Rose explained. <text:s/>She also noted that Wild&apos;s had puffed up her coat. <text:s/>On anyone else it would have been an attempt to seem bigger, but Rose already knew Wild would not need to pretend. <text:s/>Given her abilities this was not something Rose wanted to see tested and implored, “Please, go back to Ponyville with Fluttershy.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P127"><text:tab/>“But--” Applejack started, but was interrupted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:span text:style-name="T212"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t want to see you making the situation any worse.” Rose snapped and this time Applejack begrudgingly listened. <text:s/>She made her way back to Ponyville with Fluttershy, and Rose breathed a sigh when she was out of sight. <text:s/>Rose </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T213">cooed to</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T212"> Wild, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T213">It&apos;s alright dear, you don&apos;t need to be afraid anymore. Can you calm down for me?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P128"><text:tab/>“I...” Wild hesitated before hissing, “I can&apos;t, it might be a trap.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P129"><text:tab/>“It&apos;s not a trap, we just want to help you.” <text:s/>Twilight pleaded now that she understood what was happening. <text:s/>She also tried to move in for a hug, but Rose stopped her with a hoof. <text:s/>Confused Twilight asked, “The books said to reassure ponies in a panic attack. <text:s/>What&apos;s wrong with giving her a hug?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T396">“A... hug?” said Wild perplexed. <text:s/>Her muzzle scrunched up as her mind went to work on the new information. She whispered, “An interrogator would never risk contacting the infected.” <text:s/>Her coat flattened back down as she realized, “That&apos;s right I already consumed them.” <text:s/>One more realization caused her eyes to widen, and she pulled Twilight into a hug. <text:s/>A few tears landed on Twilight&apos;s back as Wild apologized, “I&apos;m so sorry Twilight. <text:s/>Thank you for trying to give me a hug, but my coat was stiff enough at the time to poke you full of holes. <text:s/>Also the venom would have paralyzed you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T396">Twilight&apos;s eyes shrunk to pin pricks and she whimpered, “Oh, thats a pretty good reason... but how did you know Rose? <text:s/>Also, its nice to meet you, I&apos;m Twilight Sparkle.” <text:s/>Wild released the mare from the hug.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T396">Rose Bloom,” Rose responded, </text:span>“<text:span text:style-name="T396">Her coat puffed up. <text:s/>Animals do that to seem bigger, but I don&apos;t know of any animal larger than a square mile of forest. <text:s/>I figured this scamp here was up to something sneakier.” <text:s/>Rose sighed, “That was a pretty fast emotional turn around you just had, how are you feeling?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T397">Along with having an absurd biology, my brain is just as alien.” Wild lectured, “My mind is a copy of me as a human, but my brain isn&apos;t an organ anymore. <text:s/>The brain in this body is actually defunct, and my entire body function as a distributed brain of sorts. <text:s/>Right now I literally have a brain that spans a chunk of the Everfree, but most of that brain power is spent processing the sensory input of said chunk.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T397">You&apos;re avoiding the topic.” <text:s/>Rose declared while Twilight tried to make sense of the new information. Rose gently continued, “I know you may not want to talk about it, but it really would help. <text:s/>Are you willing to tell us what happened in your past?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T397">I...” Wild stammered, “I don&apos;t know.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T397">I&apos;m willing to wait the entire day if you need, but this has to be your decision.” Rose bargained, “We care about you, Wild.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T398">After considering it, Wild this was ultimately unavoidable for her. <text:s/>She relented, “Alright, I doubt there will be a better time for this, but first trying to maintain two bodies is getting to be a headache.” <text:s/>She walked over to a tree and hung her bag on a convenient low branch. <text:s/>She sat down against the trunk and leaned back into the tree. <text:s/>To the surprise of the other ponies Wild closed her eyes, and bark grew across her coat to securing her to the tree. <text:s/>“Ok, I need more practice with multiple bodies, its harder than I thought,” She effused now that she only had to manage a single immobile form.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T399">How are you speaking,” Twilight inquired looking around for the source of Wild&apos;s voice.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T399">It&apos;s the leaves. <text:s/>I learned how to reproduced sounds for amusement, pretty helpful now.” Wild explained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T399">You&apos;re stalling again” Rose said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T399">Right,” Wild conceded, “first I would like to emphasize that I was among the weakest physically. <text:s/>I&apos;m not much of a fighter, even now after taking over these trees I would not stand a chance if I tried to fight in fair battle. <text:s/>So, I spent most of the time hiding as one of the other refugees in the city. <text:s/>I even ended being called Athena. <text:s/>Not accurate, but no one knew my real name. <text:s/>The worst part was that safety was only couple miles away, but we were quarantined and no one could be bothered to simply let the uninfected out. <text:s/>I know they could detect the virus, they just didn&apos;t care.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T399">Twilight and Rose were laying down at this point just listening. <text:s/>Wild continued, “The whole disaster ended up being some unholy cross between a zombie plague, and a miniature war. <text:s/>The refugees were neutral which just meant that we were simply used by the two factions involved. <text:s/>Blacklight, a secret paramilitary group, used us as test subjects. <text:s/>The infected just viewed us as food. Now, the infected at the beginning were almost entirely zombies. <text:s/>There were two exceptions the one who released the infection and me. <text:s/>We were the only two that could control it through some quirk of fate. <text:s/>Unfortunately, my parents and me were all infected shortly after the initial outbreak.” <text:s/>Wild paused as she remembered the event. <text:s/>“That was the second worst time of my life. <text:s/>My entire body was ripped apart and reassembled and I remained conscious through the whole process. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t even get enough time to catch my breath before being attacked. <text:s/>My parents died and were twisted into deformed caricatures of a human that were barely recognizable and they were hostile to everything. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t look infected so they attacked, but I wasn&apos;t human so they couldn&apos;t infect me or kill me. <text:s/>I was cut and ripped to pieces before they left me for dead.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T400">Both ponies were crying at that point, allowing Wild to reflect on the memory. <text:s/>She realized that </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T400">her parents were never properly laid to rest. <text:s/>None of her friends and family were for that matter. <text:s/>There was never an opportunity back then, but now she could give them a memorial. <text:s/>She could actually get some closure.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T400">Rose was the first to speak up, “I don&apos;t know what to say. <text:s/>You&apos;ve gone through more than anyone in Equestria has save for the Princesses.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T400">Don&apos;t worry, just listening is enough.” <text:s/>Wild reassured, “It actually is nice to finally talk about it. <text:s/>I couldn&apos;t before since it would have given away what I was.” <text:s/>A tension that had been with her was eased, but it was replaced by another when she thought about the next part of her story. “Are...” she began, but hesitated. <text:s/>“Are you still willing to hear the next part? <text:s/>It only gets worse at this point.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T401">Both ponies just nodded to that. <text:s/>Wild was still reluctant, as she collected her memories of that time. <text:s/>She had buried them, but now they would be revealed. <text:s/>She would also have to reveal another fact she did not want to admit, even to herself. <text:s/>She steeled her resolve, ready to take the plunge despite the risks. <text:s/>She confessed, “I&apos;m a murderer.” <text:s/>As expected she was met with confusion, but with the first step taken it was easier. <text:s/>“I&apos;ve killed and eaten people, over a hundred at this point. <text:s/>Many of them innocent, but some of them were irredeemably evil. <text:s/>Those ones I enjoyed. <text:s/>I hate that I enjoyed it, but I really did want those ones to suffer.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T401">Rose had a pensive expression, but Twilight looked like someone had just jammed a lemon in her mouth. <text:s/>Rose had only a single, “Why tell us this?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T401">I hate hiding, that was what let Blackwatch become the monsters they are.” <text:s/>Wild returned since she had been asking herself the same. <text:s/>“Regardless of the results, I just want to stop hiding it, stop worrying about what might happen if you found out. <text:s/>That and I&apos;m of the opinion that its better to air your own dirty laundry than to let someone else do it for you.” <text:s/>The expression confused the other two, but the context was clear enough. <text:s/>Rose seemed satisfied with the explanation, but Twilight was not.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T401">Surely there was a better way, you didn&apos;t need to kill them.” <text:s/>Twilight blurted out.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T401">There may have been a better way for the evil ones, but I&apos;m not perfect. <text:s/>Everyone has they&apos;re breaking point and they pushed my past mine.” <text:s/>Wild reasoned, “You can judge for yourself after hearing what they did, but I do not regret killing them. <text:s/>The innocent ones were a different matter completely, I still can&apos;t see a way they could have survived. <text:s/>The only mercy I could give them was a quick death.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T401">Seeing Twilight build up for an argument Rose butted in, “Twilight, let&apos;s hear the full story first. <text:s/>Not everywhere is as peaceful as Equestria, and sometimes killing really is the kindest thing you can do.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T401">Thank you.” Wild said, “This part of my life is where I picked up most of my neurosis. <text:s/>I learned the hard way that regeneration and a photographic memory can be double edged swords. <text:s/>At the time I was still new to my abilities, and they mostly worked on their own. <text:s/>Fire and automatic regeneration are a terrible combination. <text:s/>The first time I encountered it was from a Molotov cocktail, a glass bottle with alcohol and a burning rag in it. <text:s/>One the other refugees discovered my infection and </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T401">hit with it. <text:s/>The regeneration made sure that my nerves worked as the fire continuously ate away at my flesh. <text:s/>It would have killed me, but I wasn&apos;t that lucky. <text:s/>Instead some nearby Blackwatch members heard the screaming, and put out the fire. <text:s/>They didn&apos;t let me die, I was too useful to them instead I was kept in a glass cage. <text:s/>I have no idea how long I was in there, there only thing to judge the passage of time with were the... feedings”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T401">Rose&apos;s face paled as she realized the implication and tried to deny, “No, please don&apos;t tell me they...” <text:s/>She couldn&apos;t finish the thought, and Twilight was left confused.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T401">What were they doing?” Twilight worried looking between the two ponies.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T401">I think Rose guessed it, but these people value efficiency above ethics. <text:s/>I wasn&apos;t the only infected they had captured, and despite how strange out metabolism may be, it still existed. <text:s/>We needed to be fed if they wanted us alive, and there happened to be a large source food nearby if you lack morals. <text:s/>They fed us the refugees, they just tossed them into the cages and then no more refugee. <text:s/>It was also a convenient way for them to dispose of bodies too.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T401">Now enlightened, Twilight responded by violently purging her stomach on the nearest tree. <text:s/>Glad for a reprieve from the current topic Wild commented, “Twilight, you seem to be making a habit out of this. <text:s/>Although I probably am the only pony who doesn&apos;t mind being vomited on.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T401">But I didn&apos;t hit you.” <text:s/>Twilight countered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T401">Deciding it would be a good idea to mark which trees were her, Wild grew tendrils on the trunks of each tree colored to match her coat. <text:s/>It looked like vines had suddenly engulfed the forest. <text:s/>Then she explained, “I literally am every tree with a green trunk. <text:s/>Something I did not consider the implication of properly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T401">Oh,” Twilight choked, “and I just... <text:s/>I&apos;m so sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T401">Seriously, don&apos;t worry about it.” <text:s/>Wild chuckled, “I cover hundreds of acres, you aren&apos;t even the only creature currently making a mess on me. <text:s/>One of those implication that I didn&apos;t consider.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T401">Oh, yuck, Wild.” both ponies complained in unison at the imagery. <text:s/>Rose continued, “We should get back on topic though. <text:s/>I get the impression there&apos;s still more to come.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T402">There is, Blackwatch was very interested in me since I was one of two known anomalies with the Blacklight virus. <text:s/>In order to aid their study of me, they required my cooperation be it voluntary or forced. <text:s/>I assume there are magical methods of mental control.” Receiving a nod from Twilight, Wild continued, “Well, I don&apos;t know what they are like but the mundane ways to brainwash someone are brutal. <text:s/>Fire is one of the few things that produced a &apos;satisfactory response&apos; as the scientist put it, so that&apos;s what they use to control me for the most part. <text:s/>I was too stubborn for that to break me though, so they moved onto psychological tactics.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T402">The leaves on every one of Wild&apos;s trees shook briefly before she continued, “That was what finally broke my will completely. <text:s/>At least as far as they knew. <text:s/>Turns out that having a conscience can be a problem when dealing with monsters. <text:s/>I hated feeding time, but I had to eat. <text:s/>At first it wasn&apos;t too </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T402">bad though, the food was brought in dead. <text:s/>I could rationalize that easily, they&apos;re dead they don&apos;t need a body anymore after all. <text:s/>It maybe cold, but that got me through most of the time. <text:s/>Then I tried to defy them, and that&apos;s the first time I got to experience a live feeding. <text:s/>They put some man into the cage with me and left.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T402">Wild hesitated before she could get the next part. <text:s/>When she was able to progress again the volume of her voice wavered from the emotions as she stammered, “At first I was confused about why they would put him here. <text:s/>My guess was that he was supposed to be a spectator when they brought the dead body later. <text:s/>Soon enough confusion gave way to boredom and we both sat in our own little corners until our keepers returned. <text:s/>Only they didn&apos;t, and I was the first to realize what was going on when the hunger pangs showed up. <text:s/>I don&apos;t experience hunger the same way as you, instead of sensation its just the knowledge that I am running low on energy. <text:s/>Then as I get lower my mind starts getting fuzzier, I think slower, my vision gets worse, and I start to lose focus on things. <text:s/>The last thing I saw was the terror on the man face as my body began falling apart. <text:s/>Then I woke up in his body slumped against the wall of the cage and looking at my own corpse. <text:s/>The best I can figure out is that whatever mental connection the virus produces failed and it reverted back to its default highly infectious state.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T402">This time it was Rose that had the most dramatic reaction. <text:s/>She had to get up before the Wild even finished and expelled her own stomach. <text:s/>What came out though was not what Wild expected. <text:s/>It was thick dark green fluid that glowed slightly. <text:s/>She made a note of the oddity and collected the fluid to investigate later. <text:s/>Sitting back down Rose rasped, “How are you still sane?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T402">There are two answers to that. <text:s/>The Blacklight virus is a very mixed blessing. <text:s/>It is great at copying and storing information, but its not perfect. <text:s/>My emotion are somewhat off, I have less empathy now, and weaker emotional responses. <text:s/>The virus is much more suited to analytical thinking making me more resilient to trauma.” Wild elaborated, “The more significant reason is that, I&apos;m not sane. <text:s/>Not completely at least. <text:s/>You already know my feelings about fire, and I have a compulsion to answer questions. <text:s/>Whatever else they may be Blackwatch is effective and that held true for there interrogations. <text:s/>They wanted reliable answers from me so they made me unable to ignore or knowingly lie when asked a question.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T402">Magic can&apos;t do that.” <text:s/>Twilight stated, “You can&apos;t just make someone tell the truth.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T402">I said knowingly lie. <text:s/>Its not objective truth, its what I regard as true.” <text:s/>Wild corrected, “Also, my world had no magic. <text:s/>Both myself, and everything the Blackwatch does are purely physical.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T402">Twilight cocked her head to the side, but otherwise stayed silent as she contemplated the possibility. <text:s/>However, Rose noticed something else and pointed out, “So that&apos;s what happened with Applejack. <text:s/>We have been forcing you to answer questions.” <text:s/>She went on to inquire, “You became more manipulative to counter it didn&apos;t you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T402">Yes, the original programming was for the complete truth, but I managed to weaken it down to just the technically correct truth. <text:s/>That leaves me with plenty of wiggle room, and I just think of it as a personality quirk.” Wild explained, “Unfortunately, Applejack triggered a relapse. <text:s/>While not verbose, I would have answered any question honestly and directly.” <text:s/>As an after thought Wild added, “Please, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T402">don&apos;t try to abuse that. <text:s/>Along with the obvious, it&apos;s also dangerous. <text:s/>You could easily be labeled as Blackwatch agents in that state with possibly... fatal consequences.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T403">How much danger was she in?” Rose demanded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T403">Relatively little, but still too much.” Wild confessed, “My response to her were escalating, and if she pushed enough...” Wild trailed off before quickly pointing out, “She would have a hard time actually hurting me, and probably would have ended up temporarily paralyzed at worst.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T403">Rose sighed, “I&apos;ll have to talk with her about picking her fights better.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T403">Also, there&apos;s one more part left.” Wild added.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T403">It gets worse!” Twilight exclaimed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T403">Yes, that wasn&apos;t the only live feeding. <text:s/>After that one though I didn&apos;t let myself starve again. <text:s/>Instead I would try talking to them and killing them quickly while distracted. <text:s/>It was as much as I could <text:s/>do for them.” <text:s/>Wild said before explaining, “Assuming that the memories are intact, I end up with a copy when I consume a creature. <text:s/>I have the memories from every single person I&apos;ve killed, its more trouble than its worth. <text:s/>For most its just having to experience their death that&apos;s the worst. <text:s/>Seeing from their perspective as I watch myself kill them, knowing every thought going through their head at the time. <text:s/>The Blackwatch guys were the worst though. <text:s/>Their monstrous acts weren&apos;t limited to me and I got see all of their crimes, all of their victims. <text:s/>I got to know with certainty that the were enjoying every second of it. <text:s/>I also got to see that they were not happy with me trying to be nice to my victims.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T403">Building up steam behind her rant Wild seethed, “I don&apos;t know how, but they found my best friend, Jenell Patterson. <text:s/>She was my last friend too. <text:s/>Before the outbreak I was just an average teenage girl with plenty of friends doing teenage girl stuff. <text:s/>Unfortunately, teenage girls don&apos;t have a good survival rate in zombie infested ruins. <text:s/>We all died in the end. <text:s/>Instead of staying dead though I got to be the one to kill the last of my friends. <text:s/>Unlike the others they told her what was happening before dumping her in my cage. <text:s/>For instant she was happy to see someone familiar before remember what I am and switched to terror. <text:s/>Then I saw the moment her brain kicked in and she realized why she was really there. <text:s/>That she was being used to break me. <text:s/>I just sat there like a lump repeat the word &apos;no&apos; when she offered to kill herself. <text:s/>She figured that she wasn&apos;t getting out of there alive regardless, so why not made it easier for me. <text:s/>I also later learned that she thought that having her entire life permanently etched into my memory was a better remembrance than most people got. <text:s/>In the end though a glass jar doesn&apos;t give many options to kill oneself and I had to do it. <text:s/>We hugged one last time, and right before the end she said &apos;I&apos;m sorry&apos;.” Wild wailed, “She apologized to me even though I wasn&apos;t the one that was going to die.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P235"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T404">Everfree weather was always strange, but this was the only time it rained without a single cloud in the sky.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P290" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 11</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T404">Most of the morning had passed by the time that the ponies recovered. <text:s/>There was still one </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T404">question that Rose and Twilight had not gotten the answer to. <text:s/>“How did you escape?” Rose asked, “I can&apos;t imagine they just let you go after all of that.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T405">They didn&apos;t. <text:s/>I don&apos;t really know if it was negligence or complacency, but they let the cage deteriorate. <text:s/>In order to actually contain me they needed a hermetically sealed container, but I still need oxygen in order to breathe so there was self contained unit that recycled the air in the chamber. <text:s/>The unit was in a separate location though with a duct connecting the two.” <text:s/>Wild explained, “In an act of petty defiance I would probe the cage daily for weakness. <text:s/>I guess they never noticed since they never punished me for it. <text:s/>One day I found the weakness I needed, the seal between the cage and the air duct was cracked. <text:s/>I couldn&apos;t fit my whole body through that, but I could send a dust sized piece of myself through. <text:s/>That was all it took, slowly I used that little piece to collect biomass outside while keeping it hidden. <text:s/>I don&apos;t regret what I did after that,” she sighed, “but I cannot deny that it was a brutal and merciless act.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T406">Wild&apos;s friends were paying rapt attention at this point, though their ears folded back at the last statement. <text:s/>“I figured &apos;hey I&apos;m basically a disease why not act like it&apos;. <text:s/>I infect the first person I could and set up a little beachhead for myself. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t want to be noticed though so I stayed asymptomatic and just worked on being infectious. <text:s/>A sneeze here, or unwashed hands was enough to spread me without any of them noticing. <text:s/>They actually did have detectors in case of containment breach, they never considered that I might take the slow methodical route though. <text:s/>The amount of infection in each person was too small for them to detect so I could basically move freely.” <text:s/>Wild laughed, “The preparation were completed without incident and that was the first time I smiled since the outbreak. <text:s/>I think one of the guards noticed, but by then I was letting the virus run wild in all of them. <text:s/>I just sat in my cage listening to the sirens going off and watching the panic in the nearby guards. <text:s/>There was nothing they could do at that point, the entire facility had been infected at the same time as far as they could tell for the few minutes they had to live. <text:s/>From there all I had to do was pick a body and walk out.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T406">That&apos;s...” Twilight started, but couldn&apos;t finish. <text:s/>She sat there wide eyed, not know what to think.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T406">Monstrous.” Wild finished for her, “I know. <text:s/>I don&apos;t have a justification for it, but I didn&apos;t get out of without consequence either. <text:s/>That was what earned me the code name Athena, and shot me to the top of their list of targets, on par with the one who released the virus in the first place. <text:s/>Also I consumed all of those people, I got all of their memories. <text:s/>They were all Blackwatch members, and now I have to live with detailed knowledge of every crime they committed. <text:s/>I basically inherited all of their sins. <text:s/>In the end they broke me, but they didn&apos;t expect that I would remake myself into a monster to break them in return. <text:s/>The only redeeming quality being that I only target bigger monsters.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T406">I don&apos;t know what to think.” Twilight glumly said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T406">All I can tell you is that there are no black and whites, everything is a shade of gray.” Wild replied, “Blackwatch was originally created to protect the people. <text:s/>The lost their way, but even now they still have the same goal. <text:s/>It&apos;s just been twisted beyond recognition.” <text:s/>She took the time to shift back into her pony body since the worst of the conversation was over.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T406">As far as I am concerned, having to live with all of the memories is a better penance than anything I could do.” <text:s/>Rose asserted. <text:s/>She frowned in thought before asking, “Would you do any of that in Equestria?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T406">Wild frowned in return, met Rose&apos;s eyes and stated, “Yes, its not just self-deprecation when I say I&apos;m a monster. <text:s/>I would kill them all over again if I were back in that situation, and I would do the same for any Equestrian monsters as well. <text:s/>Though even that bomb the other day is nowhere near what it would take for me to respond that way. <text:s/>I would rather just let the guards handle it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T406">Rose shook her head and snorted, “Not ideal, but then I suppose nothing is perfect. <text:s/>At least you acknowledge your faults. <text:s/>You may be a monster, but you are also a good pony.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T406">How can you be both?” Twilight puzzled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T406">One bad trait doesn&apos;t make all the others bad.” <text:s/>Rose explained, “Although, there may be a correlation between there.” <text:s/>Twilight did not look convinced, but her stomach had its own argument. <text:s/>It growled loud enough for everyone to hear as she blushed. <text:s/>“It is about lunch time.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T406">The three ponies headed back to Ponyville. <text:s/>Rose split off to go find Applejack, Twilight returned to her library, and Wild decided to continue camping in front of the fountain again. <text:s/>This time she was paying attention for any suspicious ponies which was easy since the rest of the town was giving her a wide berth. <text:s/>While waiting to see if someone would talk with her Wild decided to play around with her new forest. <text:s/>She want to add sonar to the trees. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T44">Huh, I think I might be paranoid, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T214">Wild wondered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T44">but damn it I like seeing everything around me. <text:s/>And they actually are out to get me.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:span text:style-name="T214"><text:tab/>Her waiting payed off in a sense, a pony actually approached Wild. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T215">When she opened her eyes she found Lyra approaching her with a blank expression. <text:s/>Stopping in front of Wild, Lyra just stared for a second before asking, “Do you have any concept of subtlety?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P130"><text:tab/>“I was pretty good at it before I got here. <text:s/>Now that I think about it that probably had more to do with the number of people, and everyone worrying about not dying.” <text:s/>Wild answered not sure where this was going. “Maybe not.” Wild concluded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P130"><text:tab/>“You stick out like a sore hoof.” Lyra groaned planting her face in her hooves. <text:s/>“You really did take over a chunk of the Everfree forest, didn&apos;t you?” She accused.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P130"><text:tab/>“Yes, nobody was using it, so it seemed like a good idea at the time...” Wild confessed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P130"><text:tab/>“Why?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:span text:style-name="T215"><text:tab/>“Oh, I want to build a house there.” Wild professed, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T216">I think its lovely location now that I can keep all of the larger creatures away.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P131"><text:tab/>“You needed a whole square mile for a house?” <text:s/>Lyra deadpanned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P131"><text:tab/>“Yep,” <text:s/>Wild chirped, “most of it is a buffer to keep out unwanted visitors, but I&apos;ll make a pond, and maybe some other landscaping.” <text:s/>Her ears lowered when she said, “I also want to make a memorial.” <text:s/>That got a few gasps from the ponies that had start gathering to watch the conversation. <text:s/>Its <text:soft-page-break/>not everyday you get to watch the two craziest ponies in town argue. <text:s/>They did not expect that last comment. <text:s/>“I&apos;ve already lost everything else, I only have memories left. <text:s/>So I&apos;m going to make a memorial for them when I can find the materials.” <text:s/>Wild declared.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:span text:style-name="T216"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T217">Hearing that the spectating ponies did not know what to say. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T216">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T217">How did you lose them?” a mare asked from behind the crowd. <text:s/>The mare made her way to the front and revealed herself as Applejack.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“A plague struck the city I lived in.” Wild responded surprised that Applejack wanted know, “I lost some to plague itself, but it was a slow attrition as everything around us fell apart. <text:s/>Lack of food, or clean water and exposure to the winter ended up being too much. <text:s/>I am the only one that managed to escape.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“You must be pretty special, how did you escape?” <text:s/>Applejack inquired now joined in the group with Lyra and Wild.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“I didn&apos;t think I was that special, but someone else did. <text:s/>I was summoned here by someone named Gaia.” <text:s/>Wild said, “I&apos;m not really sure why. <text:s/>She basically just said &apos;I brought you here, have fun&apos; and left me in the Everfree forest.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Gaia?” both Applejack and Lyra questioned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“She also said some called her Mother Earth.” Wild supplied.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“That explains some things.” Lyra mumbled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>Applejack decided to switch topics and challenged, “What did you mean when you said you took over part of the Everfree forest? <text:s/>You some kind of forest spirit?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“No” Wild stated at the same time as Lyra stated, “Yes”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Well which is it?” Applejack demanded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“She is literally part of the forest now. <text:s/>She controls the plants and land, and can project herself through them from what I understand. <text:s/>Even if she hasn&apos;t realized it yet, she is the spirit of the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Well, a relatively small part of it at least.” answered Lyra before Wild could respond.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Huh, I never thought about it like that.” Wild mused with a hoof on her chin, “Yeah, I guess I am a forest spirit now. <text:s/>Neat.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“So, you&apos;re not some kinda zombie?” Applejack asked with narrowed eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>Wild went to answer, but Lyra put her hoof in Wild&apos;s mouth. <text:s/>“She means undead, with necromancy and all that implies.” Lyra addressed to Wild before reclaiming her hoof.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Oh, no I&apos;m not undead or anything. <text:s/>Just a 19 year old girl thats been through too much including dieing a couple times. <text:s/>My ability to heal myself still works if I&apos;m technically dead.” <text:s/>Wild answered while Lyra face hoofed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“That sounds to me like you used necromancy.” Applejack accused before pulling out a strange object. <text:s/>It was a metal disc about the size of a hoof with an ankh engraved into it. <text:s/>She tossed it to Wild <text:soft-page-break/>who caught it on reflex to the surprise of Applejack.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“Nope, just normal cell division accelerated a little.” Wild countered as she inspected the new object. <text:s/>“What&apos;s this thing? <text:s/>Some kind of coin or something?” <text:s/>Wild asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P132"><text:tab/>“It&apos;s a ward of life, if you had been undead it would have disrupted the magic animating you.” <text:s/>Lyra explained and turned to Applejack. <text:s/>“I assume you believe us now.” she insisted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:span text:style-name="T217"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T218">Alright,” Applejack relented and her ears drooped. <text:s/>“I was wrong about you Wild Way. <text:s/>I&apos;m sorry for how I&apos;ve been treating you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P133"><text:tab/>“I forgive you.” Wild replied, “and here is your thingy back.” She hoofed the disc back to Applejack who put it away.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P133"><text:tab/>The crowd had started to wander off when a wagon entered the square drawing their attention. <text:s/>When it stopped in an empty area a stage popped out and a blue unicorn mare with a light blue mane stepped out. <text:s/>She was wearing a cape, and wizard hat with stars on it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:span text:style-name="T218"><text:tab/>“A magic show?” marveled Wild, “What&apos;s a magic like with real magic?” <text:s/>The trio went to join the rest of the crowd watching the show. <text:s/>Applejack wander off when she saw one of her friends, but Lyra stayed next to Wild. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T219">The stage mare introduced herself as The Great and Powerful Trixie, and proceeded to perform a variety of basic tricks, after bragging about vanquishing an Ursa Major.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:span text:style-name="T219"><text:tab/>“Alright, this is less interesting than I imagined.” Wild pouted, Lyra just shrugged. <text:s/>Then Trixie challenged the town. <text:s/>First Applejack went up there and did a series of lasso tricks. <text:s/>Trixie countered by using the lasso to hog tie Applejack. <text:s/>Next up was a blue pegasus with rainbow mane, she did some aerial tricks and made a rainbow upon landing. <text:s/>Trixie used lightning clouds to shock the mare off the stage. <text:s/>The final challenge was a white unicorn with curly purple mane. <text:s/>She created a costume out of pieces from the stage, but Trixie just turned her mane green. <text:s/>That was enough for the white unicorn as she ran off crying. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T220">Well, that was a let down. <text:s/>At least the ponies from ponyville were pretty talented.” <text:s/>Wild sighed then added, “I would like to see her take on an Ursa Major though.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P134"><text:tab/>“A traveling performer and the only good thing about her show were the local ponies.” Lyra agrees and shakes her head. <text:s/>“She would get torn apart by the Ursa.” Lyra retorts.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P237"><text:span text:style-name="T220"><text:tab/>“Not if she runs fast enough.” <text:s/>Lyra goes her own way and Wild returns to trying to set up forest wide echolocation. <text:s/>By the evening she managed to get the network of sensors working for her and integrated to created one continuous view of her entire forest. <text:s/>Already she had found some interesting things since she was better able to judge size. <text:s/>There were about half a dozen changelings hanging out in the branches, presumably </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T221">lookouts for the hive. <text:s/>There were also a pair of small ponies running through the forest, but they were too far away to get a clear image of. <text:s/>The fact that the ground started shaking slightly after they passed was suspicious. <text:s/>Increasing the height of one of her trees Wild was able to see of the rest of the Everfree forest and spotted an Ursa Minor. <text:s/>“Seriously, at least its only a minor one. <text:s/>Um, what to do.” Wild complained before deciding that Twilight was the closest person she knew that might be able to help. <text:s/>She did not want to kill it since it was only a child.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>Wild had her roots increase their density in an empty patch of her forest, and five groups of trees to twist together into large columns. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>While this was happening she had her pony body run to Twilight&apos;s library. <text:s/>“Twilight, we got a problem.” Wild shouted and banged on the door. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>Her roots had finished growing and created a solid mass in the general shape of a pony without legs or abdomen. <text:s/>The head raised above the forest floor. <text:s/>The outside of the mass had formed an even tighter mesh to point of essentially being armored. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“Twilight” Wild continued to shout while dancing in place anxious to get the mare&apos;s attention. <text:s/>The Ursa was just a few hundred feet from her forest which meant that it was less than a mile away. <text:s/>Twilight opened the door and asked, “What is it?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>Back in her forest the torso of her construct was being lifted by the five columns that had connected to it. <text:s/>One for each leg and the last for a tail. <text:s/>The columns were being filled out for extra muscle mainly in the hind legs. <text:s/>The tail was changing into a collection of vines and had separated from the ground already.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“There&apos;s an Ursa Minor heading to the town and its only half a mile away. <text:s/>I&apos;m going to stop it from entering but I was hoping you had a good way of getting it to leave.” Wild blurted out. <text:s/>As an afterthought she added, “Oh, and two young ponies were running through the Everfree forest right before it showed up. <text:s/>I&apos;m going to head over there now.” <text:s/>Wild began walking toward the forest where she figured the giant would appear.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>Wild&apos;s giant was almost complete and had the general shape of a pony albeit an unnatrually thin one. <text:s/>In order to make it more friendly looking she added green moss to fill in the silhouette. <text:s/>Each leg lifted one by one to test it and detach it from the ground. <text:s/>The construct bent down and jumped over the <text:s/>forest between it and the plain outside of town.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>Wild had stopped just past the edge of town and watched her timber pony come in for a landing. <text:s/>The colts had already run past so the landing area was clear and the Ursa Minor was only a few seconds from appearing out of the tree line.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>Twilight, the timber pony and the ursa minor all showed up at the same time. <text:s/>The ursa minor was giant bear with a coat that appeared like the night sky. <text:s/>It was the same height as the surrounding trees and Wild&apos;s timber pony though it out massed the collection of dirt and trees. <text:s/>Twilight had stopped <text:s/>right next to Wild and just stared at the giant creatures in front of her. <text:s/>The bear was not as hesitant and charge the giant pony. <text:s/>The giant pony shifted to face the bear and braced for the impact by digging into the ground. <text:s/>A loud clap sounded as the pair collided and while the pony held out against the charge parts of the outer layers were knocked off.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“The pony ones mine, if you have a plan for the bear now would be the time.” Wild explained without moving her body. <text:s/>Trying to maintain two was still beyond her but since the giant did not have eyes or mouth she could use the ones on her main body. <text:s/>Fortunately the bear was not able to get past Wild and just tried to bash apart the cobbled together body. <text:s/>Some cracks appeared and dirt would spill <text:soft-page-break/>out but they would heal just a quickly.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>Twilight set to work using the wind and some nearby cattails to play a lullaby. <text:s/>She also grabbed a water tower and filled it with milk. <text:s/>The ursa minor was more amicable and accepted the makeshift bottle. <text:s/>A little bit of rocking while levitating and the bear cub was asleep again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“I can take him back if you put him on the pony&apos;s back.” Wild offered and Twilight gently placed the ursa minor on the giant pony. <text:s/>Both giants then headed off into the forest following the trail the bear had left earlier. <text:s/>“Well, this has been an interesting day, but I think I am ready for it to end.” Wild stated.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“Agreed.” Twilight mumbled and gets a look of curiosity. <text:s/>“How are you navigating the giant pony? <text:s/>It didn&apos;t have eyes and you can&apos;t see it from here.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“Sonar. <text:s/>I&apos;ve had a lot of time to kill so I spent it tinkering with abilities. <text:s/>Acoustics tended to be a common area for me to tinker in.” Wild answered. <text:s/>“I could reproduce practically any kind of sound, but I haven&apos;t figured out how to make a sonic cannon yet.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“You&apos;re trying to make a weapon?” Twilight challenged with a scowl.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“Not really, thats just a name. <text:s/>A sonic cannon produces sound in a beam instead of an expanding sphere. <text:s/>One thing that I learned from getting all that knowledge from Blackwatch is that anything can be turned into a weapon with enough creativity. <text:s/>I also believe that any weapon can be turned, as it were, back into a plowshare.” Wild elaborated, “For a sonic cannon it all depends on the volume. <text:s/>Loud enough and you have a weapon, but keeping it to a normal volume you have a neat way to transit sound much further than you otherwise could.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>The ursa made it back to its mother and the giant pony went to return to the ground it was formed from. <text:s/>Twilight looked pensive when she commented, “You are one hard to understand mare.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“Maybe, but I think the real problem is I don&apos;t fit into existing categories.” Wild giggled at Twilight&apos;s consternation. <text:s/>“Alright, the ursa&apos;s back home, and now all thats left is clean up.” Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>At this point Lucent had made his way to the two mares after calming the crowd that had shown up to the earlier spectacle. <text:s/>“Hello, Miss Way. <text:s/>I take it this was another attempt on your life?” he questioned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“No, actually this one was just a couple of local colts. <text:s/>I noticed them running through the Everfree chased by the ursa. <text:s/>I get the feeling they were doing something ill advised, but not malicious.” Wild recounted causing Lucent to rub his forehead.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“This town is going to be the death of me.” Lucent grumbled. <text:s/>“And that wooden golem? <text:s/>I take that was yours.” <text:s/>he inquired standing in front of Wild. <text:s/>Her ears folded back when she realized that Lucent probably did not know of her recent activities.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“Well, you already know what I can do, and that wasn&apos;t a golem that was still me. <text:s/>I got the material for it from the Everfree forest.” <text:s/>Wild responded but did not want to meet his eyes. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t know if you heard, but I am now literally part of the forest. <text:s/>Specifically the part with all the vine <text:soft-page-break/>covered trees. <text:s/>That giant was only a minute fraction of my total mass that I cobbled together for this.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“And how much is your total mass?” Lucent deadpanned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P135"><text:tab/>“Don&apos;t you know not to ask a lady her weight.” <text:s/>Wild scolded, but Lucent did not react. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t know how much I weigh. <text:s/>I&apos;ve never measured the weight of a forest.” <text:s/>Wild relented. <text:s/>Lucent had a few more logistics questions, but once that was done he and the other ponies had wandered off. <text:s/>Wild decided that she was over due for a nap. <text:s/>A nice 36-hour nap.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P286" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 12</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P238"><text:span text:style-name="T221"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T222">During her nap Wild also set to work on a couple projects. <text:s/>Underground she had found a wealth of gem deposits and decided to make the foundation of her home using them. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T223">Pockets of other minerals and access to the aquifer underneath the forest allowed her to make a strong concrete. <text:s/>She had gotten a lot of knowledge including material science information from Blackwatch and now she could try it out with some interesting materials.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P302"><text:tab/>She dug several tendrils straight down near the center of her forest to provide access to the bedrock. <text:s/>A cylinder of changeling chitin was grown about 20 feet across stretching the entire height and filled with dirt. <text:s/>The next step was to create veins through the structure to provide extra strength and the ability to repair any damage. <text:s/>Finally the dirt would be removed and concrete mixture added simultaneously starting at the bottom. <text:s/>All she had to do was run water through the vein to keep it coll and wait. <text:s/>After that and she would have a spider web reinforced sapphire concrete pillar as a solid support.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P238"><text:span text:style-name="T223"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T224">She constructed six arches the same way that met the column just above the surface of the ground. <text:s/>Letting them sit and harden she created a sort of underground test chamber to find a way to create gems biologically. <text:s/>She did not have the slightest clue how to go about it so she just threw everything at it. <text:s/>Cells were created to try various tactics and combined based on result in a recreation of evolution. <text:s/>It may not be fast be she would find out how to lonsdaleite. <text:s/>If she was going to create a memorial then it was going to last and a mineral harder than diamond sounded perfect for that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P238"><text:span text:style-name="T224"><text:tab/>Morning came by and Wild was fully refreshed even with her projects. <text:s/>She entered the town and remember that she had nothing to do today. <text:s/>Walking down the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T225">street she was accosted by a pair of fillies. <text:s/>One was pink with a tiara the other was gray and the both had the stereotypical snobby air about them. <text:s/>“I thought you were, like, gone. <text:s/>We don&apos;t want you here because you&apos;re a monster, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T251">and a blankflank</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T225">.” <text:s/>the pink one sneered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P136"><text:tab/>Quirking one eyebrow at the ridiculous pair, Wild assured, “What an adorable pair of brats. <text:s/>I can assure you that I am going to be here a long time, and I am a far bigger monster than you think. <text:s/>However, I eat sunlight so Ponyville&apos;s not in danger.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P238"><text:span text:style-name="T225"><text:tab/>“We&apos;re not brats.” the brat raged. <text:s/>“I&apos;m going to tell my dad, and like, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T226">he will get rid of you.” she threatened and trotted off with her nose in the air. <text:s/>Her friend followed shortly behind, and Wild chuckled at their antics. <text:s/>At the same time a group of ponies was approaching her</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P238"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T226"><text:tab/>“Wild there you are. <text:s/>Princess Celestia wants you to help us remove a dragon.” Twilight </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T227">announced. <text:s/>“We need to hurry before he covers all of Equestria in smoke.” <text:s/>Applejack, Fluttershy, and Pinkie Pie were behind her with two other mares. <text:s/>A white unicorn with a curly purple mane and blue pegasus with a rainbow mane were also part of the group.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“Does she want me to slay a dragon?” <text:s/>Wild wondered with a sight tilt to her head.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“NO. No, that is not how we handle things, Wild.” Twilight scolded, “She just wants us to persuade the dragon to move somewhere else.” <text:s/>The other five had similar remarks to make.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P137"><text:tab/>“She should know the kind of person I am. <text:s/>I don&apos;t know what she expects me to do against a giant dragon...” Wild said before making a realization. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t suppose this is a non-fire breathing dragon.” Wild fretted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P238"><text:span text:style-name="T227"><text:tab/>“Yes, its a fire-breathing one. <text:s/>That&apos;s why there&apos;s a smoke filling the sky.” <text:s/>Twilight </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T228">grumbled. <text:s/>Wild looked up to see that there was a indeed a cloud of smoke extending from nearby mountain.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P138"><text:tab/>“Oh.” Wild squeaked, “Are you sure you need me?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P138"><text:tab/>“What, a big mare like you is afraid a dragon. <text:s/>Don&apos;t worry you have THE Rainbow Dash with you.” <text:s/>the blue pegasus bragged.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P238"><text:span text:style-name="T228"><text:tab/>“Alright, I come along, but I not going to look.” Wild said unconvinced. <text:s/>The group was confused about what she meant until she pulled out a silk cloth and tied it around her head. <text:s/>Now complete the group went to the mountain, and Wild trekked with them as if she were unimpaired. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T229">They tried to climb up the mountain, but Applejack had to take the long way since Fluttershy was too scared. <text:s/>They ended up waiting on wider part of the trail.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P138"><text:tab/>“Hello dear, I don&apos;t believe we&apos;ve met before. <text:s/>I am Rarity the owner of Carousel Boutique.” the white unicorn stated. <text:s/>“If you don&apos;t mind me asking what material is your blindfold made of?” Rarity inquired.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P138"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m Wild Way, current assassination target of Ponyville. <text:s/>Spider Silk, I actually make it myself and tend to use it whenever I need fabrics.” Wild answered and pulled out another swath of it to give to Rarity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P138"><text:tab/>“You don&apos;t say. <text:s/>I may have to buy some from you, if you are selling.” <text:s/>Rarity said while distracted by inspecting the fabric.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P238"><text:span text:style-name="T228"><text:tab/>Rainbow Dash had heard the introduction too. <text:s/>“Wait, now I remember you. <text:s/>You&apos;re that mare that keeps hanging around the town square and blew up.” <text:s/>she proclaimed </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T229">pointing a hoof. <text:s/>“That was so awesome, and gross. <text:s/>How can you survive so much damage?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P139"><text:tab/>“Strangely enough through non-magic powers. <text:s/>I only need a small amount of myself to remain intact and I can regenerate from it. <text:s/>That explosion actually did next to nothing to me once I collected all of the pieces.” <text:s/>Wild explained.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P139"><text:tab/>“No way that wasn&apos;t magic. <text:s/>You&apos;re like some kind of superhero.” Rainbow <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P139"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“Be careful what you ask Rainbow, she will answer you no matter how unpleasant the answer.” <text:s/>Twilight warned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P238"><text:span text:style-name="T229"><text:tab/>“I bet you have some kind of awesome past.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T230">Rainbow said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m not really up to dig that up again, but Twilight knows. <text:s/>Everyone in it was a monster or turned into one including me, and I don&apos;t mean monster in form.” Wild sighed. <text:s/>Conversation died down until Applejack arrived with Fluttershy in tow. <text:s/>The continued on until they came to a gap in the path. <text:s/>Most of the ponies were able to simply jump over. <text:s/>When Wild jump she landed with a distinct thump surprising the others.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“You got some meat on you, what have you been eating?” Applejack exclaimed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“Lately, sunlight. <text:s/>I&apos;m a photovore.” <text:s/>Wild proclaimed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“Autotroph. you&apos;re an autotroph.” Twilight corrected.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“I knew there was a better word. <text:s/>I am an autotroph now that I can grow leaves.” <text:s/>Wild repeated and raised a foreleg with leaves sprouting from it. <text:s/>After a few seconds she shook them off and seeing all the perplexed faces asked, “What?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>Shaking their heads the ponies just continued on. <text:s/>When they reached an avalanche zone they made it half way through before Fluttershy screamed in fear and triggered an avalanche. <text:s/>Large rocks fell all around them as they tried to make it back to safety. <text:s/>One of the rocks was poised to hit Twilight, but Applejack was able to push her away. <text:s/>When Wild saw that Applejack was now going to be hit she repeated Applejack&apos;s actions pushing Applejack out of the way. <text:s/>The rock landed on Wild and was followed up by the bulk of the falling material and buried her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“She saved me.” Applejack marveled and began digging.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“That&apos;s just the kind of person she is. <text:s/>She would give her life to save others, but can mercilessly kill monsters. <text:s/>I can&apos;t figure out what to think about her.” <text:s/>Twilight admitting sharing the issue that had been bothering her with her friends.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“What do you mean darling?” Rarity inquired.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“She told me about what happened to her. <text:s/>She went on a rampage of sorts and killed dozens of terrible people. <text:s/>She even enjoyed it, but then she does something like this. <text:s/>I just can&apos;t figure out how someone can be a good monster like that.” <text:s/>Twilight ranted starting to pant a bit.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>“So she&apos;s the monster that other monsters are afraid of. <text:s/>As long as she isn&apos;t going after anyone in Ponyville I don&apos;t see the problem.” <text:s/>Rainbow Dash stated and shrugged. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>The rocks in the debris pile started to shift and a black tendril came out. <text:s/>As the ponies watched it slithered out and coiled up on the ground. <text:s/>When all of it had gathered together smaller tendrils erupted from it and began taking the shape of a pony. <text:s/>Shortly afterward Wild was standing in front of the group once again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P239"><text:span text:style-name="T230"><text:tab/>“Ya know, I&apos;m just going to stop trying to make sense of the things you do.” Applejack decided </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T230">the others silently agreed except Pinkie Pie. <text:s/>She never really would about others making sense in the first place. <text:s/>Continuing on the group made it to the peak without further problem. <text:s/>Only Wild noticed that there was a pony already up there. <text:s/>His stealth was ineffective against a blind mare, but she decided to wait and see what he would do. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T45">Hmm, only Celestia knew we would be here so is this her spy?, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T230">Wild <text:s/>pondered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P239"><text:span text:style-name="T230"><text:tab/>The plan ended up being each pony going in one by one. <text:s/>First Twilight, then Rarity went in and came back unsuccessful. <text:s/>Pinkie was next and went in wearing a... something. <text:s/>At that point Rainbow Dash was done with waiting and flew into the cave. <text:s/>Fortunately, Wild was able to reel her back in with her spider webs. <text:s/>“Woah there, you trying to get yourself killed.” <text:s/>Wild said, “You need more </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">than</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T230"> enthusiasm to take on a dragon, at least let me go find out what the problem is.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P140"><text:tab/>Rainbow grumbled at that and waited impatiently. <text:s/>Wild went into the cave hoping that she could overcome her fear of fire if it came to a fight. <text:s/>“Alright, You already know what we are here for, but I want to know why here? What&apos;s so important about this cave?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P239"><text:span text:style-name="T230"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">The dragon stared down at the strange mare either insane or brave enough to approach a dragon blind folded. <text:s/>“I doubt you would understand, but there is a new creature that has claimed the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">surrounding</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231"> area. <text:s/>I intend to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">prove it wrong</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">.” the dragon said and laid down again. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T46">Whelp, I guess I&apos;m slaying a dragon, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">Wild thought, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T46">How am I going to explain this?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P239"><text:span text:style-name="T46"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">You mean the town? <text:s/>What creature is this?” Wild asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P141"><text:tab/>“Ha, seems you are beneath its notice. <text:s/>Not surprising the creature is strong enough to stop one of those star bears.” the dragon laughed before laying his head down again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P239"><text:span text:style-name="T231"><text:tab/>“Well, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">he came to fight a creature that claimed Ponyville and can stop an Ursa</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">.” <text:s/>Wild said to the ponies. <text:s/>Twilight was the first to understand the implication.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P143"><text:tab/>“You. He&apos;s here to fight you.” <text:s/>Twilight said dragging her hooves down her face.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P240"><text:span text:style-name="T231"><text:tab/>“Yep, t</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">his is a territory conflict between huge predators</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">There&apos;s going to be a fight and one of us is not coming out alive</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">.” Wild said and braced for the backlash. <text:s/>Neither Twilight nor Fluttershy like the idea of fighting, Pinkie&apos;s hair deflated, and Applejack was worried about Wild getting injured. <text:s/>Rarity just called it &apos;uncouth&apos;, but Rainbow Dash was ready to go.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P240"><text:span text:style-name="T231"><text:tab/>“You can&apos;t, fightings not the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">right</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">way</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">. <text:s/>He just needs to be taught how to be nice to your fellow being.” <text:s/>Fluttershy said. <text:s/>Wild had started shifting herself to a fighting form. <text:s/>It was similar to her human one, but covered in thick chitin and looked androgynous. <text:s/>She also had 10 inch long razor sharp claws on her hands. <text:s/>Everything except the white claws was black.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>“This is the wild, things are kill or be killed here. <text:s/>He challenged me, and now I am going to meet that challenge. <text:s/>Maybe he will give up and leave, but this is happening.” <text:s/>Wild declared with more confidence than she had. <text:s/>Between her words and her appearance she cowed the rest of the group.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>“Wow.” said Rainbow Dash. <text:s/>With that Wild entered the cave her mantra still going strong in her mind. <text:s/>The dragon rose up to his full height when he noticed her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“What is it that you hope to gain from this?” Wild asked the dragon.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P240"><text:span text:style-name="T231"><text:tab/>“Nothing. <text:s/>I&apos;m just here to get rid of competition.” <text:s/>he answered with a laugh. <text:s/>He drew in a breath as Wild stood in front of him. <text:s/>She would later claim that she let the flame wash over her to demonstrate her resilience. <text:s/>In reality she was paralyzed with fear. <text:s/>Either way the changeling chitin she was using was able to handle dragon flame just fine. <text:s/>“So you are</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">n&apos;t a complete fool</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T231">.” the dragon said seeing that his breath had no effect.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>Wild charged forward under the dragons attempt to grab her and slashed at his underbelly. <text:s/>She was able to scratch some of the scales, but did no substantial damage. <text:s/>She needed something to get past the natural armor. <text:s/>A quick survey of the room and she found her answer. <text:s/>The gold covering the floor would provide plenty of weight all she had to do was grab it and put it into a hammer. <text:s/>The dragon had a similar idea and was pounding at the floor forcing Wild to hop around the cave. <text:s/>In order to create an opening she picked up a rock on the floor and took careful aim. <text:s/>When she threw the rock it did not have enough force to break through the scales, but it was enough to make the dragon reel back when it entered his eye.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P144"><text:tab/>Wild was able to scoop up some of the gold and form a hammer at the end of her arm. <text:s/>Not wanting to waste the opportunity she jumped off one of the walls to get up to the ceiling. <text:s/>Using all of the power she could she launch herself from the ceiling onto the dragon&apos;s head. <text:s/>Swinging her hammer in midair she delivered massive blow and forced the dragon into the cave floor. <text:s/>That hit cracked the dragons skull, and enraged him. <text:s/>“I will kill you.” the dragon roared.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P240"><text:span text:style-name="T231"><text:tab/>The dragon began swiping at Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T232">trying to catch her. <text:s/>She managed to dodge a few, but the erratic nature of them proved too much. <text:s/>She was grabbed and could not get enough leverage to break the hold. <text:s/>The dragon did not waste any time and threw her into his mouth. <text:s/>Sliding down his throat Wild screamed, “This isn&apos;t over.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P240"><text:span text:style-name="T232"><text:tab/>Trying to sink her claws into any surface she could Wild discovered that dragons were even armored on the inside. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T47">OK, this is bad there isn&apos;t enough good air here, and I can&apos;t cut through, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T232">Wild panicked, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T47">and this acid is actually strong enough to dissolve me. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T232">Going out the way she came in was not possible so Wild went with the only other exit. <text:s/>Prying it open she entered the dragons intestines and discovered that the armoring stopped. <text:s/>She cut through the side and heard a muffled roar from outside. <text:s/>To her surprise trying to consume the softer dragon flesh did not work. <text:s/>A shift in orientation and soft thud signaled the dragon falling over. <text:s/>Not wanting to stay any long Wild picked a direction and started digging. <text:s/>By the time she escaped the guts a few holes had been burned all the way through her armor and she gave her own scream of pain. <text:s/>The dragon writhed on the ground never having felt much pain before.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P145"><text:tab/>“I don&apos;t think you can survive that.” Wild said looking toward the wound she made. <text:s/>She moved to his head and quickly sunk her claws into the previous wound. <text:s/>Once again she was unable to consume the dragon, but she could at least give him a quick death.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>Walking out of the cave Wild rejoined the ponies. <text:s/>She looked terrible with pits melted out of her armor. <text:s/>The acid had even eaten chunk out of her shoulder and legs revealing the muscle <text:soft-page-break/>underneath. <text:s/>Her claws had plenty of notches and one looked ready to fall apart with the number of holes through them. <text:s/>“He ate me.” Wild said, “What in the world do dragons eat that he can actually digest me?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Gemstones.” <text:s/>Twilight answered on autopilot as she just stared at the sight before her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Right, Gemstones. <text:s/>That would do it.” Wild said as one of her claws clattered to the ground. <text:s/>“I recommend you guys go back to Ponyville. <text:s/>This bodies pretty much hit its limit, so I&apos;ll meet you there.” <text:s/>she continued when one of her legs gave out and she dropped to a kneel. <text:s/>“Sorry you had to see this.” was the last thing she said before collapsing and killing the remaining virus inside that body.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>A quick trip and Wild was back at her fountain flopped on the edge. <text:s/>She was idly running a hoof through the water while wait for the others to return. <text:s/>Her wait was not very long, but she only sensed one pony approaching.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“What&apos;s got you down?” <text:s/>Flitter asked once Wild turned to her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“I slayed a dragon today.” <text:s/>Wild sighed and caused Flitter to pull back in surprise.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“A dragon, where did you find a dragon. <text:s/>You didn&apos;t hurt that one that lives with Twilight did you?” <text:s/>Flitter asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Nah, Spike&apos;s fine, but anther one decided to settle down in that mountain. <text:s/>Apparently he heard that I had claimed the Ponyville area, and wanted to challenge me. <text:s/>Problem is I wasn&apos;t alone and I am not looking forward to the conversation when they get back.” <text:s/>Wild answered indictating the mountain with the dissipating smoke cloud.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“So that was a dragon causing that smoke. <text:s/>I&apos;m glad he&apos;s gone, although I would have preferred a different way.” <text:s/>Flitter said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Honestly, I agree with you and would have just let him leave, but he ended up eating me. <text:s/>With the damage I caused getting out, it was kinder to just mercy kill him.” <text:s/>Wild said. <text:s/>A few moments of silence passed before Wild asked, “Why do you seem so calm about this?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Pegasi tend to be more aggressive since we were the main military force in the past. <text:s/>We know that dealing with threats is price of peace.” <text:s/>Flitter explained before both of the mares noticed a fast approaching yellow object. <text:s/>Before they could see what it was Wild has already been knocked off her hooves and landed in the fountain. <text:s/>Regaining her composure after the sucker punch she saw that Fluttershy had arrived and was livid.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“You, You jerk. <text:s/>You didn&apos;t have to kill him. <text:s/>He was just trying to take a nap.” <text:s/>Fluttershy shouted as she advanced on Wild. <text:s/>Wild actually retreated from the irate pegasus as a crowd gathered to watch once again.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“He was covering Equestria with smoke, and had challenged me. <text:s/>What was I supposed to do? I even tried talking one last time, but only got a stream of fire for my trouble?” <text:s/>Wild defended from the fountain that she was forced back into. <text:s/>Fluttershy was staring Wild directly in the eye with a surprising amount of intensity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“We do not fight others.” <text:s/>Fluttershy stated when Wild noticed strange activity in her brain. Normally her brain is inactive, but now the fear center of her brain was active.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P241"><text:span text:style-name="T232"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T47">What in the world? <text:s/>Is she trying to directly influencing my mind, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T232">Wild worried. <text:s/>She hoped the answer was no, but needed to find out. <text:s/>“Are you trying to control my mind?” Wild asked to the surprise of Fluttershy. <text:s/>Now it was Fluttershy&apos;s turn to back away until she flew away with tears in her eyes. <text:s/>“What just happened?” Wild asked to air now confused over Fluttershy&apos;s behavior.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>No one spoke after that, but one stallion did start laughing. <text:s/>The rest of the crowd turned to watch the amber colored stallion. <text:s/>“The horrible monster terrorizing Ponyville, and she gets sucker punched by Fluttershy. <text:s/>What&apos;re we supposed to afraid of again?” he asked to no one in particular.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“She&apos;s a demon.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“She&apos;s a zombie.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“She&apos;s a blank flank.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Well, that last one&apos;s true.” <text:s/>Wild said while climbing out of the water. <text:s/>“What&apos;s so scary about being a blank flank?” she asked the crowd. <text:s/>The crowd just looked at each other. <text:s/>Twilight and the rest of the girls showed up and worked their way through the crowd.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“It just ain&apos;t right for grown mare your age to not have a cutie mark.” <text:s/>one of the ponies shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“But, I&apos;m still a teenager, and the cutie mark thing is just a lack of magic.” Wild said. <text:s/>All noise in the crowd stopped at that.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“What” said one of the crowd, voicing everyones question.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Yep, I&apos;m only 19, and my coat is just dyed green since gray is boring.” <text:s/>said Wild causing the crowd to start awkwardly shuffle around. <text:s/>They began to wander off. <text:s/>The amber stallion was once again laughing as he left.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“So, slaying a dragon, that sounds interesting. <text:s/>I bet it was an epic fight.” Flitter prompted to diffuse the silence. <text:s/>Wild coughed and avoided eye contact.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Um, I kind of got eaten. <text:s/>Again.” Wild grumbled and added as an after thought. <text:s/>“They got one powerful digestive tract.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“That would explain why your body started to eat through the rock.” <text:s/>Twilight observed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“So you had to climb back out his mouth. <text:s/>Awesome.” <text:s/>Rainbow said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Not exactly.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P146"><text:tab/>“Oh so you...” Pinkie started. <text:s/>“Eww.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P241"><text:span text:style-name="T232"><text:tab/>“Perforated bowel actually.” Wild said. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T233">Rainbow had to land from how hard she was laughing, and Twilight winced having an idea of what such a wound would feel like. <text:s/>“Oh, Fluttershy came by, I don&apos;t think she&apos;s very happy with. <text:s/>She packs more of a punch than I expected.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P241"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T233"><text:tab/>“Wait, Fluttershy punched you?” Rainbow asked receiving a nod from Wild and Flitter. <text:s/>“I think I&apos;ll go see if she&apos;s OK.” <text:s/>Rainbow announced before flying off. <text:s/>Rarity </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T234">left to scour the dirt from her coat and Pinkie had wandered off at some point too.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“Well, I&apos;m off too, but I am glad the dragon isn&apos;t covering Equestria in smoke anymore.” <text:s/>Applejack said before returning to Sweet Apple Acres.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>Twilight frowned before sighing, “I don&apos;t like how you handled the dragon, but I can&apos;t really see an alternative.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“That just means that you still have a working conscience. <text:s/>I think mine might be skewed.” <text:s/>Wild said. <text:s/>“Oh, this might be a strange question, but do you know anything about mind control magic.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“Not much, just that most of it is more emotional influence instead actually control. <text:s/>You didn&apos;t learn how to use magic recently did you.” Twilight answered while her horn lit up. <text:s/>After awhile she frowned and accused, “Why can&apos;t I barely even detect you with magic?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“Um...” Wild voiced and tapped her chin before she made a realization. <text:s/>Tendrils ran across her coat removing the changeling chitin before she asked, “Alright, how about now?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>Twilight lit her horn again and said, “Well, it works again, and you still don&apos;t have any magic. <text:s/>What did you do?” <text:s/>Twilight had narrowed her eyes in suspicion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“Um, I found a fireproof chitin and used it to make my hair and skin. <text:s/>Looks like it has other properties too.” <text:s/>Wild answered, but avoided eye contact.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P241"><text:span text:style-name="T234"><text:tab/>“I&apos;ve never heard of something like that, do you have a sample I could borrow?” Twilight gasped. <text:s/>Wild took a sample out of her bag shaped like a small beetle shell, and Twilight took off as soon as she had it in her magic. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T48">I guess levitation still works on it, but I hope she doesn&apos;t figure out what it came from too soon, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T234">Wild worried.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P147"><text:tab/>“So, how has your day been, Flitter?” Wild asked.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P287" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 13</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P242"><text:span text:style-name="T234"><text:tab/>That night Wild decided to relocate the now unclaimed hoard, but before she could get started a group of guests arrived. <text:s/>A </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T241">8</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T234"> pony sized creatures showed up and roosted </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">in</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T234"> the trees just outside of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">Wild&apos;s forest. <text:s/>The periodic high pitch clicks gave Wild a pretty good idea of what they were. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T49">Where did they come from I&apos;ve never seen them before. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">Wild wondered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T49">I hope they follow me.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P242"><text:span text:style-name="T49"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235">Wild began carving a large room underground to store the gold and a tunnel leading up the surface close to the edge of the forest. <text:s/>Then she pulled a large </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T236">pipe</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T235"> out of a tree after looking around for any ponies. <text:s/>She already knew one of the thestrals could see her, but she had to give them a reason to follow. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T236">Heading to the ex-dragon&apos;s lair she dragged the end of the tube with her and made a pipeline. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T50">Ha, I got one, gonna catch me a bat, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T236">Wild thought and smirked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P242"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T236"><text:tab/>Slowly and loudly scooping gold into the pipeline Wild was watching the bat that had stopped just outside the cave waiting for them to enter. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T50">Will you walk into my parlor, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T236">thought Wild to the bat. <text:s/>Not until she was almost done did the spy make a move.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P242"><text:span text:style-name="T236"><text:tab/>The spy slowly crept in unaware of Wild&apos;s grin as she went about her looting. <text:s/>They actually climbed to the roof once the got to the main chamber. <text:s/>Now that her quarry was inside Wild sealed the entrance with chitin from the pipe. <text:s/>The last of the gold entered the pipe and Wild was ready to see who was following her. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T50">Let&apos;s see how good her night vision is, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T236">Wild thought as she grew her hair out toward the ceiling slowly </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T243">encircling</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T236"> the pony. <text:s text:c="2"/>“And the trap is sprung.” Wild intoned. <text:s/>The spy panicked and tried to fly away, but Wild already had them in her grip. <text:s/>Making sure that the ponies wings and legs were bound Wild tilted them </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T243">so they were face-to-face</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T236">. <text:s/>“Well, what do we have here?” Wild rumbled with a deep resonating voice to the bat mare.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P242"><text:span text:style-name="T236"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T237">Wild sent the pipeline retracting back to the forest, but left the wall in place. <text:s/>She wrapped the now unconscious mare in spider webs, and hung her from the ceiling by a thread. <text:s/>The mare had gray fur and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T238">light purple mane with a set of purple plate mail. <text:s/>Wild tossed a few bioluminescent sacs around <text:s/>for light and settled in to wait for the mare to wake. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T241">6</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T238"> of the other bats had not reacted at all, but one of them had moved to investigate the pipeline and was now following the end as it retracted. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T51">These must be some newbie soldiers if they&apos;re wandering off alone, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T238">Wild thought with hooves steepled, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T51">I&apos;ve never gotten to play the monster in a horror story before.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P242"><text:span text:style-name="T51"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T238">Wild set up the next trap by moving the forest end deeper into the forest and added spider web shooters to the other end ready to entangle the pony. <text:s/>When the pony passed the edge of the forest Wild aimed for his mouth and fired. <text:s/>Wrapping him up all nice and snug and uncovering his nose he was dragged into the forest </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T239">and into the treasure room. <text:s/>He was stuck to one of the walls and Wild formed a pair of eyes on the wall across from him. <text:s/>He was a brown bat stallion with a black mane and was glaring at the new eyes. <text:s/>Wild released the rest of his snout to let him speak.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P242"><text:span text:style-name="T239"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T240">The mare was the first one to start making noise. <text:s/>When she woke up she started screaming prompting Wild to get up, walk over to the mare and shush her. <text:s/>Every time she would try to scream Wild would put a hoof to the mares mouth until she was ready to talk at a normal volume. <text:s/>“So, why were you following me?” Wild said going directly for answers.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>Nothing coherent had been said by either pony so Wild tried again. <text:s/>“Well both of you are better at not talking than not going off on your own. <text:s/>So, you guys some kind of spooky assassins or something?” <text:s/>The mare frowned at the taunt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>“We are night guards of Princess Luna.” <text:s/>the guards mare argued and since Wild had broadcast everything to both chambers the other guard heard too.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>He sighed, “Why are we in spider webs?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>“I could put you in fleshy pods if you want.” Wild offered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P148"><text:tab/>“NO” both of guards shouted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P242"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T240"><text:tab/>“Alright so if not assassin then spies, not really sure what you think you&apos;ll find. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T241">Unless you were hoping to play war games, then you came to the right place.” <text:s/>Wild said as she packed up the things in the dragon cave and put the mare on her back. <text:s/>She headed back to the forest to unite the guards, and to see what the mare would do with this opportunity. <text:s/>When they got back to the Wild&apos;s forest the guard let out a shriek. <text:s/>Wild had been waiting for something like this and repeated the shriek along the edge of the forest thoroughly masking its origin.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P149"><text:tab/>“What did you just do?” stammered the mare hearing her own voice coming from within the forest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P149"><text:tab/>“Broadcast your call. <text:s/>All your friends definitely heard, but they won&apos;t be able to tell from where.” <text:s/>Wild answered. <text:s/>Sure enough the rest of the guards were frantic at that and grouped up. <text:s/>Except for the furthest pair who entered the forest on their own. <text:s/>Wild decided to drop thin sticky threads from her branches. <text:s/>They would slowly encase the two and blend into their coats. <text:s/>When enough were in place they would stiffen trapping the ponies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P242"><text:span text:style-name="T241"><text:tab/>When she made it back to the treasure room Wild placed the mare against the wall near the other guard. <text:s/>Wild began send whispers to the wandering pair to get them lost. <text:s/>She also created a copy of the mare to use a bait. <text:s/>The clone laid down in sight of the forest&apos;s edge pretending to be unconscious. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T242">The clone was also attached to the ground and ready to stick to the first thing to touch it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P150"><text:tab/>“The trap is set, lets see who gets caught.” Wild said now that the waiting began.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P150"><text:tab/>“You sick mare, why don&apos;t you just let us go?” the mare fumed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P150"><text:tab/>“You didn&apos;t ask.” Wild stated and shifted the webbing around the two ponies into a rectangular blanket. <text:s/>“You can keep those if you want.” <text:s/>The mare quickly unwrapped herself and threw the blanket on the ground. <text:s/>The stallion folded up his and stuffed it in his armor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P150"><text:tab/>“Do you want that?” <text:s/>the stallion asked his partner.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P150"><text:tab/>“No, I do not want it.” <text:s/>the mare roared. <text:s/>He packed up the other blanket too. <text:s/>“Really.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“What? they&apos;re silk.” he said. <text:s/>Wild had been watching the two in the forest and figured that they had enough silk on them. <text:s/>She decided to stiffen just one of them when the other wasn&apos;t watching. <text:s/>Forming a human body for herself behind a tree he quickly grabbed the trapped one and headed back to the treasure room making sure to not be seen. <text:s/>She walked in as a human with her captured guardsmare and released the guards mouth. <text:s/>The first two guards were still arguing over something. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“Do they do this often?” Wild asked the still tied up mare as her human body merged with a wall.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P243"><text:span text:style-name="T242"><text:tab/>“Sometimes, but what the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T244">hay</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T242"> is going on here?” <text:s/>she replied as Wild removed the silk on her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“Impromptu war games, and I think the mare is mad because she fainted.” <text:s/>Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“Midnight Oil. <text:s/>Yeah I can see that, she&apos;s not exactly the courageous type. <text:s/>I&apos;m Midnight Blossom” </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“Wild Way. <text:s/>Ah, all the players have joined the game.” <text:s/>Wild said with a smile. <text:s/>The group of four had entered the forest, and one of them was approaching the Midnight Oil clone. <text:s/>She nudged the clone with a hoof, and got stuck. <text:s/>She decided to grab the body and get unstuck later, but instead found out the body was attached to the ground. <text:s/>She ended up stuck fully to the body and could not move in any useful way. <text:s/>“Uh oh. <text:s/>How is Oily with embarrassing situations?” Wild whispered with wide eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“What did you do?” whispered back. <text:s/>Wild had encased the pair in a mouth to begin transporting them. <text:s/>By the time the other three got to the mouth it had opened again to reveal the same ground without the ponies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“Well, I made a clone of her that would stick to anyone who touched it. <text:s/>Then attached it to the ground in a conspicuous location.” <text:s/>Wild explained. <text:s/>The attached ponies had arrived in the treasure room.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>“Oh, yep. <text:s/>That&apos;s a compromising position alright.” Blossom said. <text:s/>Wild released the mare, but Midnight Oil had already seen the pair. <text:s/>Everything stopped for just a second while everyone processed what they had seen. <text:s/>In an instant the stuck mare and Midnight Oil had switched places. <text:s/>Unfortunately, Midnight had drawn her blade ready to slaughter her doppleganger. <text:s/>She even used her special ability and lit the blade on fire. <text:s/>Only Blossom had any idea of what was going to happen. First, all of Wild&apos;s biomass near Midnight turned in tendrils and began rushing away. <text:s/>Second, water poured into room from every surface. <text:s/>Wild had made sure to have plenty of aquifer water available no matter where.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P151"><text:tab/>Blossom had braced herself for the chaos and held her ground, but the other two guards panicked and tried to flee the room. <text:s/>Instead the water rushing in pushed them to the center, and since the floor had already fled they were stuck in mud. <text:s/>In the end the fire was extinguished and the three guards where flailing trying to get out the mud pit but just got themselves more tangled. <text:s/>Blossom just watched as the mess was spread to the whole room. <text:s/>Wild had jammed herself into a corner, forgetting that she could merge with it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P243"><text:span text:style-name="T242"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T243">Well, I think it&apos;s safe to say that this mission is FUBAR.” said a large stallion that had just entered the room. <text:s/>All of the noise from the recent events allowed the rest of the squad to locate them and come running. <text:s/>Wild had regained her senses and merge back with the wall hoping everyone would forget that she was the entire room. <text:s/>“Half of my squad disappears, and now I find you mud wrestling. <text:s/>I hope there&apos;s a good reason for all of this.” <text:s/>he said before raising his voice to shout, “I want all of you outside and lined up, Now. <text:s/>That includes you miss Wild Way.” <text:s/>Wild reformed herself from the wall and ran outside with the three guards she didn&apos;t catch.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P243"><text:span text:style-name="T243"><text:tab/>The 8 ponies lined up and the commanding pony stood in front of them scanning the row. <text:s/>“Midnight Blossom, what in the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T244">buck were the five of you doing in there?” he barked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P152"><text:tab/>“War games, sir” Blossom said after a moment of thought. <text:s/>The stallions expression clearly indicate that there better be more to the explanation. <text:s/>“The target began abducting us. <text:s/>When myself and Private Dusk Breeze heard Private Midnight Oil&apos;s call we decided to attempt a rescue. <text:s/>I was immobilized and carried to the chamber where Privates Midnight Oil and Sanguine were arguing. <text:s/>It became apparent when I was released that the mission had been effectively turned into a war game. <text:s/><text:soft-page-break/>Things went wrong when Private Cereus was captured. <text:s/>Midnight Oily reacted poorly to her state and attempted to use her blade. <text:s/>After lighting it on fire.” <text:s/>she elaborated.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P152"><text:tab/>“I see. <text:s/>It seems so of you did not read the briefing very thoroughly. <text:s/>And you, what the buck made you think playing war games was a good idea?” he asked to Wild.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P243"><text:span text:style-name="T244"><text:tab/>“Well, when Oily followed me all the way to that dragon&apos;s cave, I had to find out who she was. <text:s/>Then I just figured it would be fun to see how many of you I could catch.” Wild answered practically vomiting </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T245">out</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T244"> the second sentence. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T245">Midnight Oil had bristled at the nickname, but then tensed up at the implication of the what Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P243"><text:span text:style-name="T245"><text:tab/>“Fun, right.” he drawled. <text:s/>“You turned this entire thing into a prank.” He started rubbing his eyes. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T246">I was told this would not be a normal mission, I assume you were aware of us right from our arrival.” <text:s/>Receiving a nod he continued, “What problems did you notice?” <text:s/>He was met with confused looks and cries of &apos;Sarge&apos;, but did not respond to them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P305"><text:tab/>“Going off alone, that was the biggest problem. <text:s/>My capabilities will change every time, so the lack of Intel was a moot point. <text:s/>Reaction to unusual things wasn&apos;t a moot point. <text:s/>Following odd pipes that move on their own is not a good idea, nor is rushing to a conspicuous body. <text:s/>Maybe a bit more caution when the shriek came from the entire forest border.” Wild explained and then smirked, “The last thing is that spiders don&apos;t leave threads hanging everywhere in a forest.” <text:s/>The threads on the other guard with Blossom stiffened and causing her eyes to widen. <text:s/>She tried to struggle, but could not do more than fidget and fall over. <text:s/>Wild had already grown a tendril underneath the guard to catch her. <text:s/>She let the webbing peel off after cutting in strategic location and retracted the tendril.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P243"><text:span text:style-name="T246"><text:tab/>“You just can&apos;t help yourself can you?” Sarge said with an arched eyebrow. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T247">Well, this mission is over. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">Time to head home, and Wild I can&apos;t order you to come to Canterlot, but it is strongly desired.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P243"><text:span text:style-name="T248"><text:tab/>Wild thought about the request and figured she would need to go there at some point. <text:s/>Plus, she had a delightfully insane plan. <text:s/>“OK, I </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">shall make my way to Canterlot</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">?” Wild asked with an unhealthily large grin.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P243"><text:span text:style-name="T248"><text:tab/>Sarge opened his mouth to answer, but thought better of it. <text:s/>Starting again he answered, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">If you get there before us </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">head to the castle and wait by the main entrance. <text:s/>Also, DO NOT damage either Ponyville or Canterlot.” Before departing Sarge added one more thing, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">Minimize the damage to the terrain</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">, too.” <text:s/>All of the guards looked to Wild, but she had already locked her body in place </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">as her attention moved elsewhere</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">. <text:s/>After a few minutes they </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T249">flew away</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248"> with a distinct feeling of unease.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P243"><text:span text:style-name="T248"><text:tab/>Once they had exited the forest completely Sarge looked back and did not know what he was seeing. <text:s/>A long stick was raised out of the canopy somewhere deep in the forest. <text:s/>It was two or thre times the height of the surrounding trees, and thicker than </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">most</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248"> of their trunks. <text:s/>“What in the world is that crazy mare up to?” Sarge mumbled to himself. <text:s/>Midnight Blossom had stopped with him and was look</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">i</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">ng at the odd sight too.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P153"><text:tab/>“Was it really wise to let her go alone?” <text:s/>Midnight asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P153"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“Probably not, but it&apos;s not like we could force her to. <text:s/>I would also like to have some idea of her long range transport capabilities.” <text:s/>Sarge said while Midnight frowned at the odd wording.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P153"><text:tab/>“You figured something out didn&apos;t you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P153"><text:tab/>“Hmm, it&apos;s oddly proportioned, but you should be able to figure out what that is, Corporal.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P153"><text:tab/>She squinted at it as if that would reveal its secrets. <text:s/>She got an idea when she stopped considering conventional transports. <text:s/>“Oh no, that mare can&apos;t be that insane.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P243"><text:span text:style-name="T248"><text:tab/>At the column Wild was going to use for a house she built her very first potato cannon, some of those soldiers were very enthusiastic about weaponry. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">She was using a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">5-inch projectile but the barrel of the cannon was a</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">t least</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248"> 5 feet across. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">Silk binding was used between layers of chitin to make the barrel with the inner most layer being rifled</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">. <text:s/>The pressure chamber was </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">a huge bulb at one end that had muscle tissue covering its entire surface and a ball valve connecting to the barrel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">. <text:s/>She created some eyes to watch the maiden voyage, and squeezed the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">bulb as tight as possible</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248">. <text:s/>Her Transonic Potato Cannon was locked and loaded.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P244"><text:span text:style-name="T248"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">Along with the rings a green contrail also highlighted the path of the projectile. <text:s/>A long hiss of escaping air followed a low rumble from the guns firing. It could be heard in Ponyville, but was not enough to wake most of the ponies still asleep.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T248"> <text:s/>Along with the explosion the bullet had caused multiple sonic booms. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">The guns barrel had extensive cracking, but held together for the most part. <text:s/>It would not be firing again though.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P244"><text:span text:style-name="T249"><text:tab/>“WILD WAY, WHAT DID YOU DO?” shouted </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">Rose who had been stalking toward the forest when she saw the spectacle</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T249">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">Seeing the line of fire ended near Canterlot Rose thundered,</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T249"> “I&apos;M GOING TO TAN YOUR HIDE IF YOU LIT CANTERLOT ON FIRE!”</text:span></text:p>

   <text:h text:style-name="P288" text:outline-level="1"><text:soft-page-break/>Chapter 14</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P245"><text:span text:style-name="T249"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250">Wild had explained what she had been doing to Rose, which lead to the discovery that Rose was able to make good on her threat. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T251">Apparently using Rose&apos;s own chitin to coat everything had its down sides.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T250"> <text:s/>Rose </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T251">was particularly concerned about the faerie fire that Wild had managed to create. <text:s/>Faerie fire takes magic to create. Somehow Wild managed to infuse the bullet with a substantial amount of magic despite not having any magic herself. <text:s/>Which is why Rose stood before the over-sized cannon and stared at it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P154"><text:tab/>“You have no sense of propriety, do you?” Rose grumbled before inspecting the construction. <text:s/>“How far down does this column go?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P154"><text:tab/>“Five or Six hundred feet down to bedrock.” Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P154"><text:tab/>“What did you make it out of?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P154"><text:tab/>“Sapphires mostly, and cement to keep them together.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P154"><text:tab/>“Can you expose part of the core?” Rose asked with narrowed eyes. <text:s/>Her suspicion was confirmed when a section of the platform the cannon was resting on opened and bathed the area in blue light. <text:s/>“Yup, that&apos;s it you accidentally tapped in to a ley line. <text:s/>You have a nigh inexhaustible flow of magic in you, thank the Earth Mother its only going to an integrity field.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P245"><text:span text:style-name="T251"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T252">The bullet had actually survived intact because of the magic from the ley line. <text:s/>It was embedded in the side of the mountain at the center of a sizable crater of missing stone, but was completely undamaged. <text:s/>With her shifting Wild had no problem getting out of the mountain side, but since she only had about a hundred pounds to work with she decided to go with a younger version of her usual form. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P155"><text:tab/>When a couple of pegasus guards arrived to investigate the crater, they found Wild as a filly just as she was wandering off. <text:s/>“Whoa there little filly, what are you doing out here its dangerous?” <text:s/>one of the guards said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P245"><text:span text:style-name="T252"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m going to a castle!” Wild chirped with a small excited hop. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T52">Yep, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T53">I&apos;m </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T52">just an adorable filly, nothing to see here, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T252">Wild worried</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T52">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T252">“Bat Sarge wants me to meet him there.” <text:s/>she whispered to the guard.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P155"><text:tab/>“Bat Sarge, huh. <text:s/>How did you get way out here if you&apos;re going to the castle?” he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P155"><text:tab/>“I flew. <text:s/>See, I made a crater.” Wild said pointing to said crater that the other guard was looking at. <text:s/>“I think I went faster than I was supposed to.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P245"><text:span text:style-name="T252"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T253">How could you fly without wings?” the guard asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P156"><text:tab/>“A cannon.” she answered and started walking off. <text:s/>“I gotta go now. <text:s/>Bye mister.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P245"><text:span text:style-name="T253"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T254">Hold on there, you shouldn&apos;t just go off on your own. <text:s/>Who is taking care of you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P157"><text:tab/>“Nobody, I can do it myself.” <text:s/>Wild declared but was picked up by the guard. <text:s/>“Hey, what are you doing?” <text:s/>Wild pouted with puffed up cheeks from the guards back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P245"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T254"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m going to take you back to the barracks until we find your parents.” <text:s/>the guard stated and began to fly away with his partner and Wild. <text:s/>She settled down once in the air fascinated with being in the air without some kind of mechanical assistance. <text:s/>It was not long before they landed to Wild&apos;s disappointment and entered a plain stone structure near the castle. <text:s/>It had a simple courtyard surrounded on three sides by the buildings. <text:s/>It also had a second level with a balcony along the edge of the courtyard. <text:s/>There were a few guards wandering mostly with golden armor, but one was wearing the purple armor of the night guard. <text:s/>She had a lithe build with a jade green coat, and deep purple mane. <text:s/><text:tab/>Wild ran right up to the mare and announced, “You&apos;re pretty.” <text:s/>The mare just blinked completely unsure how to react. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T53">Being a child is awesome, I can get away with all kinds of stuff, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T254">Wild smiled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P157"><text:tab/>“Uh, thanks kid.” the mare guessed. <text:s/>When she looked around she saw that one of the solar guards was approaching. <text:s/>“Did you lose something?” <text:s/>she asked the guard.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P157"><text:tab/>“Sorry Captain Jade, she got away from me.” he apologized after saluting, “She is apparently looking for a &apos;Bat Sarge&apos;.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P157"><text:tab/>“We&apos;re the same color.” Wild chirped, “Also bat Sarge said to go to the main entrance of the castle.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P246"><text:span text:style-name="T254"><text:tab/>“The same color?” the captain questioned and checked to see if she had changed colors, “What are yo--” <text:s/>She got a look of comprehension and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T255">rubbed her temples. <text:s/>“You&apos;re Wild Way aren&apos;t you?” she asked and got a nod, “and you can see straight through glamors.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P158"><text:tab/>“What&apos;s a glamor?” <text:s/>Wild asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P247"><text:span text:style-name="T255"><text:tab/>Jade dismissed the private before answering, “An illusion attached to an object. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T256">How did you find the squad that I sent?</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T255">”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P247"><text:span text:style-name="T255"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T256">Echolocation, I use it pretty much all the time. Even more than I use my eyes. <text:s/>Also, I can hear a large range of sounds so when they used their own echolocation it was pretty hard to miss.” <text:s/>Wild explained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159"><text:tab/>“Ponyfeathers, we really are under prepared. <text:s/>C&apos;mon let&apos;s go wait at the castle.” Jade swore before walking out of the barracks. <text:s/>“We even use echolocation and we never considered countermeasures for it.” she huffed to herself. <text:s/>While waiting for the sergeant to arrive Jade commented, “You&apos;re presence here has caused both princesses a lot of worry. <text:s/>Princess Celestia is concerned with your willingness and ability to kill an adult dragon. <text:s/>Princess Luna was shocked about almost everything else. <text:s/>A dragon came into Equestria, nested next to a small town, and the reason its undamaged is he didn&apos;t care enough to attack it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159"><text:tab/>“So that was an Equestrian spy on the mountain then.” <text:s/>Wild observed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159"><text:tab/>“I shouldn&apos;t be surprised that you noticed. <text:s/>Full invisibility and I bet it had no effect on you. <text:s/>Whether intentional of not, you have managed to become a big part of the national defense.” <text:s/>Jade chuckled.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159"><text:tab/>“Maybe for Ponyville, but I&apos;m not exactly mobile.” <text:s/>Wild said, but was met with a look of <text:soft-page-break/>confusion. She elaborated, “This body is just an avatar, my main body is comparable to the size of a mountain. <text:s/>Even for me a mountain walking around sounds excessive.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159"><text:tab/>“You really did consume a forest.” said Jade trying to comprehend the scale.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159"><text:tab/>“And everything below down to the bedrock.” Wild said. <text:s/>When she looked over Jade mouth was opening and closing, but she did no noise came out. “Damn it, I broke another one.” Wild frowned. <text:s/>The squad arrived shortly after that, still messy from their mission.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P159"><text:tab/>“Captain!” Sarge called the rest of the squad behind him.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P247"><text:span text:style-name="T256"><text:tab/>The captain recomposed herself and said, “Sergeant, I take it you had a fun time. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T257">I can take over from here, you lot go get cleaned up. <text:s/>It looks like the debriefing will be interesting if nothing else.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T258"><text:s/>She ushered Wild into the castle as the squad departed. <text:s/>“The princesses should still be in the dining hall at this time.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P306"><text:tab/>The pair entered the dining hall and saw that the princesses were in fact there with a third pony. <text:s/>A large unicorn stallion with a pure white coat, and blond mane was sitting at the table with them. <text:s/>He was immaculately groomed and sitting behind the candelabra in the center of the table. <text:s/>“Captain, why have you brought this... urchin?” he asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P247"><text:span text:style-name="T258"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T259">This is Wild Way a rather unique individual that the princesses have taken interest in.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T258">” <text:s/>the captain responded. <text:s/>The two princesses watched from opposite ends of the table. <text:s/>One princess was clad in black and silver regalia with a matching crown. <text:s/>She had a blue coat, but her mane looked like it was made of the night sky with stars twinkling in it. <text:s/>Her cutie mark was a black sky with a white crescent moon. <text:s/>Her counterpart on the other end had a white coat the same as the stallion, but her hair was ethereal and colored like the dawn sky. <text:s/>She had gold regalia and crown with purple gems inlays. <text:s/>Her cutie mark was a sun with four flares in the cardinal directions. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T259">Both of the princess had a pair of wings as well as a horn.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P247"><text:span text:style-name="T258"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T259">Ah, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">my thanks</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T259"> Captain. <text:s/>If there is nothing else...” Luna, the blue princess responded dismissing the Captain. <text:s/>Turning back to Wild she asked, “You may sit, but I do have to ask, why are </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T260">th</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T259">ou a foal?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P160"><text:tab/>Wild sat right where she stood, getting blank looks from the others. <text:s/>“I traveled light, and being a foal is fun.” <text:s/>Wild answered while refusing to take her eyes off the candles.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P160"><text:tab/>“Impudent child, you are supposed to sit in a chair! <text:s/>And stop staring at me.” <text:s/>the stallion shouted.</text:p>
