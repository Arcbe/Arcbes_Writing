   <text:p text:style-name="P1"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>The birds chirped in the canopy above a small clearing despite the dark of night still lingering long after the sun should have risen. <text:s/>Small snaps and pops could be faintly heard as energy built in the air. <text:s/>The chirping tapered off as the rising energy became obtrusive the entire forest growing still as if holding its breath. <text:s/>The tension suddenly cut as the clearing was flooded with <text:span text:style-name="T7">actinic</text:span> light from the nearby ruins of an ancient castle. <text:s/>However, the building energy remained for a second before it reached its zenith and with a thunderous boom disappeared leaving behind a creature never before seen within this forest laying on the ground. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>The creature was a woman who had seen better days. <text:s/>She had a plain pair of faded tan jeans and olive t-shirt, <text:span text:style-name="T7">originally</text:span> being blue, and forest green respectively. <text:s/>A few rips and tears showing dust covered skin with a few scars proved that the colors were not the only thing to have a rough time recently. <text:s/>Her brown hair was relatively well cared for despite the dull appearance and ragged edges. <text:s/>There was no visible dirt or debris and while it stretched most of the way down her back was straightened out and free of mats. <text:s/>A very common and unremarkable sight for the NYZ after the Blacklight virus was released and exactly what she was aiming for. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>Standing up she took in her new surroundings. <text:s/>The sight a virgin forest with vibrant undergrowth and thick canopy brought a frown to her face and furrow to her brow. <text:s/>Plenty of forest would be interchangeable with this one, but none of them where near NYZ. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; she mused unsure how she could be here in the first place. <text:s/>Touching one of the nearby trees confirmed that the forest was in fact real and the trees were not a facade. <text:s/>Regardless of the fact she was in the middle of a ruined city only minute ago, she was now observing the surroundings in the middle of remote forest. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>&quot;This is the Everfree forest.&quot; came an answer from behind the woman. <text:s/>She spun around in surprise at this since she had already checked the forest in that direction. <text:s/>Tensing her legs she prepared to lunge either toward or away from the stranger as needed. <text:s/>Her nerves becoming more frayed as this situation makes less sense now. <text:s/>A huge woman at least 7 feet tall stood against a tree. <text:s/>She had a simple brown dress, and hair gathered together with what appeared to be vines. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>&quot;Who are you?&quot; the smaller woman asked </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>&quot;There are a few answers to that: Gaia, Earth Mother, Janet. <text:s/>The most interesting answer for you, Audrey, is that I am the one who brought you here.&quot; </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>&quot;You what?&quot; she seethed, &quot;Why would you do that?&quot; The blacklight virus in her hands beginning to grow long claws. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/><text:s text:c="2"/>&quot;Oh calm down, I think you might find this to be a fun adventure. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T7">After all</text:span>, you didn&apos;t really have <text:span text:style-name="T7">anything</text:span> tying you to New York anymore.&quot; </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>A scream erupted from the infected woman as she le<text:span text:style-name="T6">a</text:span>pt toward giant her claws aimed for the heart. <text:s/>She cleaved through Gaia&apos;s chest, however instead of falling to pieces small vines stitched the wound closed and faded back into her skin. <text:s/>After a few more swipes and an eye roll from Gaia, the infected woman finally stopped attacking. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>&quot;Finished? <text:s/>Good, I doubt you will consider me an ally, but I am not your enemy. <text:s/>I simply want to see what you will do in Equestria. <text:s/>I can&apos;t send you back, even if I wanted. <text:s/>I don&apos;t know why you even want to, you can&apos;t live with the uninfected, and you don&apos;t want to live with the evolved. <text:s/>So, what is it that you want to return to?&quot; Gaia elaborated while leaves fell from her body, &quot;Either way, good luck with the new chapter of your life.&quot; <text:s/>Gaia&apos;s body fell apart fully leaving only a pile leaves behind. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>Through the whole speech the infected woman glared after seeing that nothing she did had a lasting effect. <text:s/>Still glaring she stomped out of the clearing, kicking over the leaf pile as she passed, but without the object of her ire the anger faded away. <text:s/>Gaia was right, she did not have anything to return to, her original home was destroyed by the virus that makes up her body. <text:s/>Friends were a rarity, and enemies where literally everywhere. <text:s/>With a huff she admitted to herself that this change of scenery was an improvement. That did not mean she had to be happy about it. <text:s/>However a small part of her was thankful to Gaia. Not that she would ever admit that to the bitch. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>Consuming living creatures grants their memories and experiences to an infected. <text:s/>Around a forest though the only creatures around are simple wild animals. <text:s/>Animals may not be a good source of useful memories, but they do know the area they live in. <text:s/>An unfortunate deer bedded down in a clearing would learn this fact the hard way. <text:s/>Hiding within a few bushes proved poor as camouflage or defense against an evolved and the deer was consumed before it could even woke up. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>&quot;Good, a forest filled monsters straight out of myth. Thanks Gaia.&quot; deadpanned Audrey after assimilating some interesting memories. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>On the surface the forest looked normal enough, the deer&apos;s memories showed a variety of mythical fauna and flora such as manticores, or cockatrices. <text:s/>Another anomaly was that the memories contained a couple languages. <text:s/>Apparently even the deer were different and far more intelligent than they should be in this forest. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>Consuming a few more animals, Audrey gained enough understanding of the language to hold a <text:span text:style-name="T1">conversation</text:span>. <text:s/>She also learned of a town nearby. <text:s/>One of the residents even providing an animal <text:span text:style-name="T2">shelter</text:span> of sorts. <text:s/>This person however was not human, but instead a tiny winged horse with a yellow coat and pink mane. <text:s/>The only other part of town close enough to be known by the forest denizens was an apple orchard. <text:s/>The orchard, same as the sanctuary, was run by a family of small horses this time without the wings. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:s text:c="2"/>Not wanting to try setting up a permanent camp in the forest, Audrey needed a plan to fit in with the village. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T225">Obviously the first step would be a disguise of one of the local species. <text:s/>She could not be </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T225">human as they were not native here, none of the animals knew anything about at all.</text:span> <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T225">Getting a DNA </text:span>template <text:span text:style-name="T225">from town would be more or less straightforward</text:span>. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T225">Next a cover story, she never needed one of those before as her own life worked as a generic cover story in the NYZ.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T28"><text:tab/>Damn, I have to make a cover story without knowledge of local culture, peoples, or even the entire language. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T96">Audrey considered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T28">some variant of &apos;raised by wolves&apos; is the only thing that comes to mind. <text:s/>That could work, any mistakes can be easily forgiven due to ignorance and sympathy. Just need to say I was orphaned and left in the wild as a child due to a disaster. <text:s/>I don&apos;t even need details since it happened as a child and children are terrible at remembering things. <text:s/>Ha, perfect.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T28"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T96">Thinking of problems for the long term Audrey realized that she was practically guaranteed to be discovered either from her lack of local knowledge or just the simple fact she was effectively immortal. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T28">There&apos;s no good way around it I need allies in the know, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T96">she sighed, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T28">and if my secret is going to be revealed its better if I do it myself. <text:s/>Got to keep a look out for more open minded individual then.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T96"> <text:s/>New found resolve in place she set out to begin working on her plan.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T225"><text:s/><text:tab/></text:span>The farm was a no go right off the bat since farmers are not known for liking random creatures wandering onto their land. <text:s/>So was the sanctuary for that matter. <text:s/>Animals back on earth had the uncanny ability to detect an impostor whenever she tried to get near them as a non-human species. <text:s/>The animals of this world were not likely to be any better e<text:span text:style-name="T3">s</text:span>pecially with their increased intelligence. <text:s/>Only one real option remained, sneak into the town at night and collect some gen<text:span text:style-name="T4">e</text:span>tic samples from the populace. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/><text:tab/>When most of the lights in the town had gone out long after sundown Audrey crept her way into the town. <text:s/>In order to be more stealthy and unrecognizable she changed into a form resembling a black panther. <text:s/>Most of the traits were actually from domestic house cats and just sized up, but they worked well enough and let her hide in the shadow and travel nearly silently. <text:s/>The remaining traits were ones she worked out on her own. <text:s/>Her eyes were completely black, pupil, iris and sclera. <text:s/>She also removed the reflective layer in <text:span text:style-name="T7">the</text:span> eyes of most cats, and compensated with an increase in eye size and density of the retina to keep most of the night vision intact. <text:s/>Finally she also worked in some echolocation, having an extra method of &apos;seeing&apos; the her surrounds proved invaluable in the past. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/><text:tab/>Even at night the town had a welcoming feel to it. <text:s/>Most of the buildings were fully timbered with thatched roofs. <text:s/>Plenty of plants and other decoration spread around in an unplanned, organic. <text:s/>Basically, the exact opposite of the disaster area Audrey tried to call home for the past year or so. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/><text:tab/>Tearing her eyes away from admiring the town she made her way to one of the houses. <text:s/>Testing the door showed it was unlocked. <text:s/>Slipping through the small gap she made it inside without a single sound. <text:s/>Her paws silent on the wooden floor brought her swiftly to the back rooms. <text:s/>The first door she tried lead to a small bathroom. <text:s/>The guest bedroom was next, before finally she entered the master bedroom with a single sleeping pony in the bed. <text:s/>Now all she needed to do was get a bit of DNA and abscond. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/><text:tab/>Checking the nearby vanity supplied plenty of hair strands, but none of them had any viable cells with them. <text:s/>A short mental curse of her luck later and she was at the side of the bed. <text:s/>Carefully <text:soft-page-break/>raising a paw over the <text:span text:style-name="T5">unconscious</text:span> pony she gently gave a small poke on the withers. <text:s/>Not visible a few <text:span text:style-name="T5">minuscule</text:span> tendrils extended from the pad of her paw to collect a wealth of skin cells. <text:s/>More than enough for <text:span text:style-name="T5">Audrey&apos;s</text:span> purposes, but too few to even be able to notice. <text:s/>Retracing her steps, Audrey was on her way to next house. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/><text:tab/>A couple more houses and Audrey had collected enough samples to create a disguise. <text:s/>She could even make sure that she did not resemble any of the &apos;donors&apos;. <text:s/>Still wanting one more just to be sure. <text:s/>Everything went the same as the other houses until she was just about to retreat. <text:s/>Still facing the bed she felt a soft impact on her nose. <text:s/>A hoof was on her nose stretching to the pony just now stir<text:span text:style-name="T7">r</text:span>ing in its sleep. <text:s/>The pony had booped her snoot. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>&quot;Fuck&quot; Audrey repeated over and over again in her mind while hoping the pony would just stay asleep. <text:s/>Her mantra doubled in force when a second hoof joined the first in touching her face. <text:s/>Knowing there were only seconds before the pony woke up fully she made haste for the exit. <text:s/>Almost out of the room she heard a scream. <text:s/>Stealth was no longer an option so she broke out into a sprint and tore down the road. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>Making it back to the edge of the forest she took a look back to the town. <text:s/>Several ponies were peeking out their doors, and more houses had lights in the windows. <text:s/>Making her way deeper into the forest she snorted. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>&quot;I&apos;m sure that won&apos;t come back to haunt me.&quot; she quipped. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:s text:c="2"/>Picking a nice looking tree she sat down and began her work mixing the DNA she had collected into a brand new sequence. <text:s/>At least her mission was technically a success. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P1"/>
   <text:h text:style-name="P20" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 2</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3">Hours after the sun rose Audrey was tinkering with her new form. <text:s/>The DNA she got provided all she needed for the general anatomy, now all she needed to do was settle on the outer details. <text:s/>Colors, hair style and such. <text:s/>She needed something that fit in without drawing too much attention, but also worked with her back story. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T8">Her lack of knowledge or family in the surrounding country drastically reduced her options. <text:s/>She settled on a being a drifter, the lonely independent type with a penchant for wanderlust. <text:s/>No formal education, orphaned at an early age, and spending most of her time travel in the wilderness would attract more attention than she liked, but it would also explain why she could not answer many of the common questions. <text:s/>Besides honesty is the best policy especially in deception, and its not like she could believably pass for anything close to a typical pony.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T9">The form that she settled on was an Earth pony mare with a grass green coat and mane and tail with a mix of brown and burnt orange. <text:s/>Her coat was in order enough to not have any mats, but her mane was just mess of long hair hanging off her neck haphazardly. <text:s/>Modifying the base a bit, she added a few inches of height. <text:s/>Since she was supposed to be living in the woods, there was just enough fat on </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T9">her bones to not look completely starved, but still have a faint impression of ribs along her barrel. <text:s/>A visible scar appeared no her left shoulder and stretched to below her neck. <text:s/>A variety of smaller scars were also added, but would only be noticeable from up close. <text:s/>Finally a pair of saddlebags appeared on her back. <text:s/>Really they looked more like a couple sacks connected by a wide strap. <text:s/>The entire thing was a faded brown almost gray leather like material with signs of wear added. <text:s/>Neither sack had a clasp instead just a lose flap over the top to cover the opening. <text:s/>Inside she put a few canteens filled earlier form a river inside.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T10">Alright, I&apos;m a tiny horse and I got my stuff, am I missing anything?” Audrey wondered before realizing that she did not have a local name. <text:s/>Her name would not translate into anything pronounceable with the equine language. <text:s/>Fortunately, she could glean from the wildlife memories she had that the ponies typically went with a pair of words for their name. <text:s/>An odd trend, but an easy one to follow.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T11">Wild Way sounds good enough.” she said testing out the new name and language for this world, “I&apos;m Wild Way the Earth pony, setting out on a pony adventure to learn pony stuff.” <text:s/>Putting actions to words, Wild Way, nee Audrey, trotted off in the direction of the town.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T12">Emerging from the tree line, Wild Way continued into the town as if nothing was out of the ordinary. <text:s/>Humans let you get away with all kinds of things if you act like its supposed to be that way, maybe ponies are the same. <text:s/>Making her way into the town proper she had her answer. <text:s/>Barely a a hundred meters into the town and the stares started. <text:s/>They were not acting aggressive or frightened, but having every pair of eyes on her as she walked and they just stared. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T14">A bioweapon capable of level cities,</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T12"> she thought, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T14">and I&apos;m intimidated by pastel color ponies, in a pastel color</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">ed pony</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T14"> town. <text:s/>How </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">has</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T14"> my life </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">become </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T14">this absurd.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T45">Mustering her courage, she stopped in the middle of the road and inquired, “Is there a reason all of you are staring?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T46">Most of the ponies immediately looked away and went back to what they were doing. <text:s/>Now irritated at being ignored Wild Way choose a pony at random and marched over. <text:s/>A pegasus mare with a <text:s/>lilac coat, light teal mane, and large bow on her head. <text:s/>Seeing that the mare was looking around like she wanted to bolt away, Wild Way softened her expression. <text:s/>The mare calmed in response a little, but her eyes were still shifting looking for a way out.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T47">Look, I just want to know whats wrong.” Wild said</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T47">Um, well its just that...” The mare said before trailing off</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T47">Its just what?” </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T47">You don&apos;t have a cutie mark.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T48">What&apos;s a cutie mark?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T48">You don&apos;t know what a cutie mark is?” the mare asked, as open mouthed incredulity replaced fear.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T49">Um, no.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Its the mark on our flanks that represents our special talents.” <text:s/>She turned to show her cutie mark, a trio of dragonflies.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">OK, and how would I get one of these cutie marks?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">You really don&apos;t know? <text:s/>But, how is that possible.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T51">I haven&apos;t had the most stable life.” <text:s/>Wild responded. <text:s/>To try getting the conversation back on track and away from her history, she repeated, “Again, how do you get a cutie mark?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T51">Oh, right. <text:s/>They just appear when you discover your special talent, but what do you mean? <text:s/>What kind of life have you had?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T52">Well, my home was invaded by monsters. <text:s/>My parents died trying to protect me, and I had to survive on my own. <text:s/>I don&apos;t know how long I was there, but for better or worse some stranger brought me here.” <text:s/>Wild confessed. <text:s/>She dearly hoped being that forth coming would be worth the risk.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T53">Oh, thats so horrible.” the mare breathed as tears gathered in her eyes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T54">I&apos;ve made peace with it a long time ago.” Wild attempted to soothe, the mare began crying in earnest. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T16">Have I really become that jaded, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T56">Wild worried after seeing the reaction of a complete stranger to hearing about her life, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T16">God, I&apos;ve lost so much I&apos;m not even sure what&apos;s </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T17">left</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T16">.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T56"> <text:s/>The two mares </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T57">found </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T56">now in a hug with neither knowing who started it. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T58">They stayed that way until Wild felt a hoof poke her side.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:span text:style-name="T58"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T59">Before she could ask what the mare was doing, said mare asked, “You&apos;re so thin, when was the last time you had a good meal?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P9"><text:tab/>“Yesterday.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:span text:style-name="T59"><text:tab/>“But, its almost noon already. <text:s/>You need to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T60">get some food.” the pegasus stated before turning to walk away. <text:s/>When she saw that Wild Way was not following she turned and questioned, “Well aren&apos;t you coming.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:tab/>“Where are we going?” Wild asked as she began moving.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:tab/>“To get lunch of course.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:tab/>“But, I don&apos;t have any money.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:tab/>“Then I will buy it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:tab/>“You don&apos;t have to do this, I can take care of myself.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:span text:style-name="T60"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T61">Clearly not.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:span text:style-name="T61"><text:tab/>Wild Way sputtered at that and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T62">gave in with, “I don&apos;t even know your name.” <text:s/>That at last got the other mare to pause with a slight blush.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P11"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m Flitter.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T62"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T63">Nice to meet you. I&apos;m </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T62">Wild Way.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:span text:style-name="T62"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T64">The two made there way to one of the local restaurants. <text:s/>Along the way Wild was observing the local ponies. <text:s/>Many still watched her, but most of them went back to what they were doing quickly. <text:s/>Plenty of comments wondering about the lack of a cutie mark. <text:s/>One of the houses they passed by had a mare talking about a creature that sneaked into her house at night.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:span text:style-name="T64"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">Guess I&apos;ve become the talk of the town practically overnight, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T64">Wild noted, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18">at least they are just curious, I can work with that. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T64">She also noted a pony following them trying to remain hidden, but that did little against Wild&apos;s echolocation. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T19">Huh, I&apos;ve already picked up a stalker, not a very good one if he&apos;s acting that obvious about it, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T65">Wild analyzed </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T66">before deciding to keep track of the pony. <text:s/>It should be amusing if nothing else.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:span text:style-name="T66"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T67">The pair got an outdoor table at Cafe Hay when they arrived. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T68">The cafe had the same timbered architecture of most of the town. <text:s/>The outdoor tables had piles of hay to sit on with a vase of flowers in the middle of the table as an appetizer.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:span text:style-name="T68"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T67">Before the waiter even asked for their orders another mare showed up at the table. <text:s/>She had the same colors as Flitter though without the bow. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T68">Her mane </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T69">had white highlights and a wilder style than Flitter.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:span text:style-name="T69"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T70">Hey Flitter, who&apos;s your friend.” the new mare asked, before sitting at the table too.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P12"><text:tab/>“Hi. <text:s/>Are you new to Ponyville, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen you around before?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:span text:style-name="T73"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T74">Yes, I just wandered in today.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13"><text:tab/>“You wandered in. <text:s/>So then you must be the mare that everyone is talking about.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:span text:style-name="T74"><text:tab/>Cloud Chaser </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T81">leaned</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T74"> over to get a look at Wild&apos;s Flank before saying, “Wow, you really don&apos;t have a cutie mark.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T74"><text:tab/>“Cloud Chaser! <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T75">I&apos;m sorry Wild Way, usually she&apos;s better behaved than this.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"><text:tab/>Wild just chuckled, “Its not a big deal. <text:s/>Although sounds like I&apos;m gaining an interesting reputation.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"><text:tab/>Before the conversation could continue the waiter returned and asked for their order simply taking the presence of a third mare in stride.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T75"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T76">I&apos;ll have just have a daisy sandwich.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:tab/>Wild picked up her menu. <text:s/>Wild then put the menu down after realizing that she could not read any of it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T76"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T77">I&apos;ll just have the same.”</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T78"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T79">The waiter went back inside after collecting the menus. <text:s/>Cloud Chaser turned to Wild and asked, “If you weren&apos;t going to read the menu, why </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T80">pick it up?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P16"><text:tab/>“Well I was going to read it, but then I remembered that I can&apos;t actually read.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P16"><text:tab/>The other two mares just stared at that for a while. <text:s/>Wild Way just sat there awkwardly once she thought about how that last sentence sounded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T80"><text:tab/>“How are you so detached about this?” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T81">Flitter inquired.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P16"><text:tab/>“Its an easy problem to fix, I just never had the opportunity before to learn to read.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T80"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T82">Cloud Chaser just started laughing at that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:tab/>“Cloud! <text:s/>Quit being insensitive.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:tab/>“Lighten up, Flitter, she&apos;s fine with it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P7"><text:span text:style-name="T55"><text:tab/>Wild just shrugged and agreed, “It&apos;s not a big deal. <text:s/>Now I actually have the opportunity to learn.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T83">Flitter&apos;s response was to the drop her head on the table. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T84">The waiter returned with their orders and the meal continued without any more surprise depressing facts. <text:s/>Afterward the three of them said their goodbyes and went their </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T85">separate</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T84"> ways.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"><text:span text:style-name="T84"><text:tab/>W</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T55">ild decided to just wander around the town and get the lay of the land. <text:s/>Keeping a smile on her face she waved to and greeted every pony she could. <text:s/>Some of them even waved back, though many just gave a small return greeting before hurrying away. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T86">Along the way she made a note of the location of the important buildings like the library, and town hall. <text:s/>There were also a few truly odd buildings like the ginger bread themed bakery, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T89">and some kind of carousel building</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T86">. <text:s/>Throughout all of this the pony stalking Wild earlier was </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T87">still following</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T86"> </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T88">on her tail</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T87">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"><text:span text:style-name="T87"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T90">Taking a turn between two buildings, Wild jumped into the air and changed her hooves to soft paws. <text:s/>Landing quietly on the roof he looked over the edge waiting for her stalker. <text:s/>Sure enough </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T93">a portly brown earth stallion</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T90"> came around the corner </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T91">and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T93">began </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T91">look</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T93">ing</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T91"> everywhere </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T93">except</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T91"> up. <text:s/>He even checked some potted plants too small to conceal </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T93">anything other than house keys</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T91">, but </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T93">it would have been ridiculous to check the roofs</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T91">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"><text:span text:style-name="T91"><text:tab/>“Horseapples, how did that </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T92">undead abomination</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T91"> disappear.” he fumed and took his frustration out on a small rock. <text:s/>One final check of the alley turned up nothing for him, and he stalked away.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"><text:span text:style-name="T91"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T20">I&apos;m </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T21">undead</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T20"> now, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T91">Wild considered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T20">that&apos;s a new one. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T22">Where</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T20"> did he get that idea? <text:s/>Damn, this is going to end up a constant problem isn&apos;t it. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T91"><text:s/>Not wanting to consider the implication further she changed her hooves back, rolled onto her side, and went to sleep. <text:s/>This would just have to be tomorrows problem.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T194">A pegasus landed on the roof next to Wild Way with a clatter of hooves. <text:s/>A head with a gray mop of a mane sprang up in response and began looking for the source of the noise. <text:s/>The source turned out to be a bemused Cloud Chaser.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T194">What are you doing on the roof?” Cloud Chaser asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T194">Sleeping.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T194">I guessed that part, so why on the roof?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T194">Some stallion was following all yesterday, so I came up here to lose him. <text:s/>On a related note, do I look undead to you?” <text:s/>Wild Way inquired. <text:s/>She took the time to shift into a sitting position while Cloud Chaser tried to make sense of the question.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T195">No? <text:s/>Should you look undead?” Cloud Chaser responded. <text:s/>She then gasped, “Are you undead?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T195">Nope, but that stallion seemed to think so.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T196">Wait back up, you were being stalked. <text:s/>We need to tell the guard. <text:s/>What did he look like?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T196">We do?” Wild questioned, “He didn&apos;t seem very good at it, and I could take him in a fight.” <text:s/>She did a few punches with her forelegs to demonstrate.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T197">You should still tell the guard though.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T197">Alright, I&apos;ll do that first thing.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T198">Good, I&apos;m headed off to work. <text:s/>See you later.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T198">Wild Way watched Cloud Chaser leap into the air and begin flying away. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T23">Huh, they actually can fly with those wings, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T198">she noted, before looking at the ground below. <text:s/>A small hop and she was headed to the ground level the express way. <text:s/>Cloud, however, had also turned at the same time when she realized that Wild did not have a good way down.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T198">WILD!” Cloud yelled, and tried dive to catch her despite the distance. <text:s/>Wild just landed on the ground her legs absorbing the impact easily making the landing much softer than one would expect.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T199">What.” <text:s/>Wild yelled back in surprise.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T199">You just jumped off a building.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T200">Looking back at the building like it would offer an explanation Wild said, “Yes, it&apos;s only a couple of stories. <text:s/>Not that big a jump.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T200">Cloud gave a snicker and muttered, “Not a big jump she says. <text:s/>Alright this time I&apos;m really going, before you manage to give me a heart attack.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T200">Oh, bye again, sorry for the almost heart attack.” <text:s/>Wild earnestly replied waving at the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T200">retreating form of Cloud Chaser. <text:s/>Finding the guard house was easy after her exploration yesterday. <text:s/>Filling a report with the guard was not as successful, but at least they were aware of the issue. <text:s/>That out of the way Wild could start on her goal for the day. <text:s/>Begin learning to read and write the pony language.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T201">The local library was an interesting divergence from the local architecture. <text:s/>It was actually built into a tree large enough to contain a full three story building. <text:s/>Even more impressive, the tree was still alive and had full boughs of leaves covering a large portion of the surrounding grass. <text:s/>Going inside Wild saw that walls and the built in shelves were all composed of living wood. <text:s/>Little carving decorated the main room with a complement of tables spread around the edges of the room. <text:s/>The largest table taking the center of the room had a equine head bust. <text:s/>How the ponies managed to keep the tree alive and avoid have sap covering everything in here eluded Wild Way.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T202">Hello, welcome to the Golden Oak Library. <text:s/>I&apos;m Twilight Sparkle the librarian. <text:s/>If you need any help feel free to ask.” <text:s/>a purple coated unicorn mare announced. <text:s text:c="2"/>She had an navy blue mane with a with a pink and purple stripe near the center. <text:s/>She also had straight cut bangs that could make a ruler jealous.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">Well thats good, my name&apos;s Wild Way and I just wandered into town. I was actually hoping to find someone that could help me. <text:s/>You see I don&apos;t actually know how to read or write for that matter.” <text:s/>Wild confessed with a foreleg behind her head, “I&apos;m Wild Way, by the way.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T204">You don&apos;t know how to read.” Twilight gasped before darting off to collect a variety of books. <text:s/>By the time she was done there were over a dozen volumes floating by her head in a purple glow. <text:s/>Judging by the picture on the top books and the vibrant colors they were most likely books for young foals. <text:s/>“Here just start with the top book. <text:s/>It must be terrible not being able to read.” <text:s/>Twilight explained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T204">Oh, don&apos;t worry with the amount of time I spent just fending for my life not being able to read wasn&apos;t too detrimental.” <text:s/>Wild reassured and took the pile of books from Twilight balancing them on her hoof. <text:s/>Twilight though just stood there trying to get her mind back on track after that factoid.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T204">Setting up and little study nest at one of the tables Wild Way began working her way through the material. <text:s/>Fortunately, the Blacklight virus came with good mental improvements as well as the physical ones. <text:s/>In order to contain and process the memories it assimilates from any consumed creature the virus needed a much more organized and resilient structure. <text:s/>A side effect of this is that the infected all have a photographic memory. <text:s/>Combined with their faster ability to process information they had a superb ability to learn.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T205">Wild made full use of this to speed up studying. <text:s/>The result is that by lunch time she had already worked through most of the guides and already she had a grade school reading level. <text:s/>The rest of the books in her stack were more review than anything and could simply be skimmed for new material. <text:s/>Putting the last book back on the stack Wild got up and stretched and looked around for Twilight. <text:s/>Twilight had already gone to get her own lunch, so Wild found herself alone in the main room. <text:s/>Deciding to continue with studying she returned all of the books back to their place and select another </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T205">to read through.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T206">When Twilight came back into the room she was not surprised to find her guest still reading. <text:s/>More surprising was the fact that Wild was in a different location with a different book, and the previous collection of study material nowhere in sight.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T206">Excuse me,” Twilight asked, “where did you put the other stack of books?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T206">I finished those, so I put them away.” <text:s/>Wild answered</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T206">You put them away.” <text:s/>Twilight parroted. <text:s/>Looking around she found that all of the books were back on the shelves in their correct places. <text:s/>“How did you figure out where to put them?” she wondered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T206">That was simple, I just remembered where you got them from and put them back in that spot.” Wild smiled, “I got them all back correctly, right?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T206">Yes, yes you did. <text:s/>If you don&apos;t mind me asking, what book are you reading now?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T206">I figured that the next thing I needed was vocabulary.” <text:s/>Wild beamed. <text:s/>She turned the book over to show the title was </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T24">The Oxhoof Equestrian Dictionary.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:span text:style-name="T207"><text:tab/>“That is an effective way to increase your vocabulary.” <text:s/>Twilight agreed. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T24">I&apos;m glad to see another pony reading a dictionary. <text:s/>I almost thought I was the only one, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T207">Twilight thought. <text:s/>Both ponies settled down to return to their respective books. <text:s/>The reading pair did not last long as the door was slammed open drawing their attention as a pink pony talked in. <text:s/>This pony had a pink curly mane and tail, and pink coat. <text:s/>She was the kind of pink that only exists in nature to show a creature is far more dangerous that it seems.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">Twilight, there&apos;s a new pony in town and I can&apos;t find her. <text:s/>She must be playing hide and seek.” <text:s/>the Pink announced.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T208">Instead of Twilight, Wild responded, “Why are you looking for this pony?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">To throw her a surprise welcome party, of course.” <text:s/>All three ponies just stopped at that. <text:s/>Wild was trying to figure out this new pony, Twilight was waiting for the new pony to figure out who she was talking to, and the Pink pony was busy being pink.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">Oh hey, you&apos;re a new pony aren&apos;t you. <text:s/>I&apos;m Pinkie Pie, or just Pinkie, the welcoming committee.” the aptly named pony realized. <text:s/>Twilight just had her face in her hoof.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">Hello Pinkie, I&apos;m Wild Way.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T208">Pinkie just sat there in front of Wild staring at her. <text:s/>Slowly she leaned closer until the two ponies were almost touching snouts before popping back to her original position. <text:s/>During this Wild had simply frozen, her instincts telling her that she id not want to attract any more attention than necessary from the strange mare.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">Hmm, that&apos;s why it took so long to find you.” Pinkie muttered, “You&apos;re a something or other. </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T208">Must be G&apos;s handy work.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">What are you talking about.” Wild hazarded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">Don&apos;t worry, you will do fine. <text:s/>Also, don&apos;t be late.” Pinkie added before bouncing out through the door.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">What just happened?” Wild asked Twilight.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">You met Pinkie. <text:s/>She a nice pony, just a little ...enthusiastic. <text:s/>Also, you have something sticking out of your bag.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T208">Sure enough when she looked, Wild saw that a colorful envelope was sticking out of her saddle bag. <text:s/>Taking it in her hoof she opened it releasing a blast of confetti, and removed the card inside. <text:s/>The was an invitation for her &apos;Welcome to Ponyville&apos; party at Sugarcube Corner happening this evening. <text:s/>In the habit of not leaving any evidence of her presence behind Wild went to pick up the confetti that had popped out only to find nothing.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">Well, I think I&apos;m just going to go for a walk around town before the party.” Wild said bemused by the recent events.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T208">Alright, see you tonight.” replied Twilight.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T209">Putting away the dictionary and leaving the library, Wild picked a random direction and started walking. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T25">There is no way that was a regular earth pony, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T209">Wild thought as she meandered around, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T25">and there is only one person here I know whose name starts with a G. <text:s/>Definitely going to wary of her in the future.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:span text:style-name="T25"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T209">Wild spent the rest of the afternoon watching the weather pegasi work. <text:s/>Not only could they fly despite having wings that are too small, but they could push clouds around like they were solid objects. <text:s/>Flitter noticed Wild&apos;s wide eyed staring during her shift and went to find her again once it ended. <text:s/>Unsurprisingly Wild had not moved or stopped watching when Flitter found her. <text:s/>The two of them talked to kill time before the evening party. <text:s/>According to Flitter everyone has a reaction to meeting Pinkie similar to Wild&apos;s. <text:s/>Wild was not sure whether that made it better or worse.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T210">So there are whole cities made of clouds!” Wild gushed her eyes all but literally sparkling as they approached Sugarcube Corner.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T210">Yep, Cloud Chaser and I actually grew up in Cloudsdale, <text:s/>Equestria&apos;s largest cloud city.” Flitter answered, “If you got a cloud walking enchantment you could even visit there.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T210">Opening the door the pair entered Sugarcube Corner, Wild not even noticing as she imagined what Cloudsdale must look like.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T210">SURPRISE!” a chorus of voices shouted as the lights came on and a crowd of ponies sprang out of hiding. <text:s/>Wild managed to suppress her reaction to a small hop backwards and raised hackles.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T211">Were you surprised?” an energetic pink party pony chirped.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T211">Yes, yes I was.” Wild answered once her heart rate returned to normal. “How in the world did you manage to make a surprise party and give me an explicit invitation?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T211">If I told you that it would ruin the surprise.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T211">Ah, of course. <text:s/>Silly me.” Wild quipped with a bemused expression that was becoming the standard when dealing with Pinkie. <text:s/>Pinkie just smiled wider and began an introduction of every single pony present. <text:s/>Wild intended to mingle with the guest, but the temptation of the selection of desserts was too much. <text:s/>When you have been living off of things that normally would not be considered edible even a simple sugar cookie tasted divine. <text:s/>She ended up tasting at least one of each dessert available with a face many at the party would later recount as adorable. <text:s/>Wild refuses to confirm or deny such accusations.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T212">Leaving the food Wild set out to meet as many ponies as possible. <text:s/>Most of them were receptive and she a wealth of new acquaintances, but a significant number of ponies were wary of her. <text:s/>Many of them began looking for a way out as soon as she started talking. <text:s/>A few actually glared when she approached, so she did not even engage them as it would probably do more harm than good. <text:s/>One certain brown stallion though was enough of a curiosity that she decided to talk with him despite his best attempt at an evil eye.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T213">Putting on her best friendly smile Wild headed to her stalker. <text:s/>The stalker just frowned and held his ground.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T214">Are you enjoying the party?” Wild asked. <text:s/>The other pony just continued to glare. <text:s/>“You have been brooding this entire time, what are you upset about?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T214">I see through your disguise creature, and I will protect this town from you.” snorted the brown stallion.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T215">I&apos;m not sure what it is that you see, but I know it&apos;s not reality.” <text:s/>retorted Wild. <text:s/>The pair just stared each other down, neither willing to yield. <text:s/>Wild&apos;s curiosity eventually won out though and she questioned, “Alright, I&apos;ll humor you, what do you see behind my supposed disguise?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T216">As if you don&apos;t already know. <text:s/>You should stayed in the Everfree forest, you are not as good at hiding your nature as you think.” <text:s/>the stallion stated with an air finality and made his way to the exit.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T216">I didn&apos;t know I needed to hide it.” replied Wild before muttering “Damn, he&apos;s actually going to be a problem at this rate, and I don&apos;t even know his name.” <text:s/>Shaking her head she returned to partying, not sense letting sourpuss poop on her party.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P80" text:outline-level="2"><text:soft-page-break/>Chapter 4</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T216">The party ran to about midnight, many of the ponies leaving earlier. <text:s/>The next day was still a business day after all. <text:s/>Wild thought about helping clean up afterward, but looking around the building she could not find any mess. <text:s/>It even looked ready for business tomorrow, even the dessert table was gone much to Wild&apos;s woe. <text:s/>Only Pinkie, Wild and a mint green unicorn mare with a cyan and white striped mane.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T217">Hey, Wild Way I was hoping to talk with you do you mind if I walk with you?” the unicorn asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T217">Not at all.” Wild replied. <text:s/>A quick good bye to Pinkie and the two mares were headed down the road. <text:s/>“So what did you want to talk about?” Wild continued.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T218">Well first of all, I&apos;m Lyra Heartstrings, local conspiracy theorist or choir member. <text:s/>Depends on who you ask.” the mint pony stated, “I was hoping to learn more about your lack of a cutie mark.” <text:s/>Realizing what she had just said Lyra backpedal with “Uh.. If thats not too personal of course. <text:s/>Sorry, I had a bad habit of speaking before thinking sometimes.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T219">Don&apos;t worry about it, I have no idea why I don&apos;t have a cutie mark. <text:s/>My guess is that having to focus on survival left little opportunity to get a mark.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T219">You had to focus on survival? <text:s/>What happened?” Lyra puzzled now even more interesting in the conversation.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T219">The short story is monsters destroyed the city I lived in and it was quarantined no one could leave. <text:s/>The only reason I escaped is because of outside help.” <text:s/>Wild sighed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T219">Monsters, and a quarantine! What, were you in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T219">No...” Wild paused, “Actually I guess it pretty much was, just never thought about it that way before. <text:s/>Yeah, some of them were even resurrected corpse, though I&apos;m pretty sure they were alive instead of undead.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T219">Huh, so this is what its like to be on the other side. <text:s/>Usually I am the one telling unbelievable stories. <text:s/>Where did all this happen, if it was in Equestria I would have heard something about it?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T219">Wild stopped to consider how to answer that question. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T26">I should really be more careful, she</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T94"> thought, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T26">but screw it what&apos;s life without risks. <text:s/>Speaking of risks I already got a stalker and he&apos;s even here tonight. <text:s/>Let&apos;s see if he will get close enough that I can force a confrontation without any of my exotic abilities.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T219">Well thats the even more unbelievable part,” Wild said before dropping to a whisper, “it didn&apos;t even happen on this planet.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T219">You&apos;re saying you&apos;re an alien.” Lyra deadpanned. <text:s/>She had stopped walking and whispered as well to match Wild&apos;s change. <text:s/>“You just trying to mock me aren&apos;t you. <text:s/>You could at least come up with a more believable story.” <text:s/>she rebuked with narrowed eyes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T27">Even outright telling a conspiracy theorist the truth didn&apos;t convince her, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T95">Wild thought, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T27">I don&apos;t think I need to worry about blowing my cover. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T221">Wild smiled as she noticed a shadowed form moving in the corner of her eye hiding within a bush along the side of the road. <text:s/>she said, “I&apos;ve always found that fact is stranger than fiction, but you will have to decide for yourself whether I told the truth or not. <text:s/>Though there is one pony that seems to believe some strange things about me.” <text:s/>She resumed walking trying to discretely make her way to the bush.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T219">And look he&apos;s even here now,” Wild crowed while moving to grab the surprised stallion by the arm before he could get away. <text:s/>“What is it that you think I am?” <text:s/>she inquired without breaking stride.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T219">Lyra was staring open mouthed not expecting to see a whole pony extracted from a bush, let alone have it done so casually. <text:s/>Getting a closer look she recognized him and let out a groan. <text:s/>“Martial Bravery what are you doing here?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T219">I&apos;m making sure that this creature does not taint this village.” <text:s/>Martial declared still firmly in Wild&apos;s grasp, “Creature leave now or I will have to take stronger measures.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T220">OK, I am definitely getting annoyed with you. <text:s/>I have no intentions of leaving, and I strong recommend against escalating. <text:s/>I don&apos;t want to start a fight, but you can be sure that I will end one.” Wild threatened.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T220">Wild I&apos;m sure this is just a misunderstanding, Martial can be overzealous and pain in the flank, but he&apos;s pretty harmless.” Lyra placated the end punctuated by a wet meaty thud. <text:s/>The three ponies went through an interesting mix of emotions. <text:s/>Lyra eyes widened as her pupils shrunk to pinpricks the mounting horror causing her mouth to hang open and face to pale. <text:s/>Martial went through a roller coaster of emotion starting with pride at escaping turning to fear when he realized he was not actually moving. <text:s/>He quickly tried to hide that behind a mask of bravery but his increasingly frantic attempts to free himself ruined that image. <text:s/>Wild only let out a long suffering sigh neither her grip nor expression of weary annoyance wavering despite the knife sticking out of her shoulder.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T220">Seriously, not even an entire minute. <text:s/>Alright fine, I&apos;m going to let the guards sort you out, and I hope you are done with this nonsense. <text:s/>Mainly for your own sake.” <text:s/>Wild explained. Martial just continued trying to break her grip. <text:s/>“Good, glad to see you are paying attention. <text:s/>Lyra I&apos;m going to go deliver this dunce, you coming with me?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T220">You&apos;re bleeding.” Lyra observed. <text:s/>Wild finally looked at the wound for the first time, the knife embedded up to the hilt, and blood running out painting a red stripe down her foreleg. <text:s/>Even without the Blacklight virus it would not be a major concern, but to Lyra its one the worst injuries she has ever seen. <text:s/>“We need to get you to the hospital quickly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T221">Lyra, calm down its just a minor stab wound, I&apos;ve had much worse before. <text:s/>It&apos;ll be fine, but I will stop by the hospital after going to the guard house.” <text:s/>Wild soothed, while repositioning Martial to carry him on her uninjured shoulder. <text:s/>Lyra did not make anymore verbal protests, but still looked to be on the verge of panicking.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T222">The trio made their way to the guard house without any more commotion. <text:s/>Martial elected to </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T222">silently fume once he realized that he was not making any progress toward freedom at all. <text:s/>Pushing the door open Wild entered the building and was greeted by the on duty officer.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T222">Ah, Miss you aren&apos;t supposed to bring ponies in yourself.” <text:s/>the officer chided.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T222">Normally I wouldn&apos;t but I caught him sneaking around in a bush spying on me. <text:s/>I can see why you don&apos;t want ponies doing this themselves, he took the opportunity to express his displeasure.” <text:s/>Wild acquiesced and turned to show her injured shoulder to the guard. <text:s/>That got her a look of disbelief.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T223">Hold on let me get some hoofcuffs, but you really should have gone to the hospital.” <text:s/>the officer gasped and rummaged around for the hoofcuffs, “Did you really walk all the way here with a knife in your shoulder?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T223">Yep, do you have somewhere to put it though?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T223">You should really just leave... and you already pulled it out.” <text:s/>the guard grimaced, “Here just put it in the bag while I take care of your assailant.” <text:s/>Handing Wild an evidence bag and quickly cuffing Martial the guard retreated into the holding area. <text:s/>Wild sealed the bloody knife in the bag and left it on the front desk.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T223">After watching the entire proceeding Lyra finally questioned, “Are you for real.” <text:s/>The two mares gave a statement for the guard when he returned and were shortly ushered out and toward the hospital. <text:s/>Only Wild heard him mutter about the town getting more insane.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T223">As an after thought Wild decided to pull out a strip of cloth and make a simple bandage. <text:s/>She has to look at least somewhat interested in keeping her all her blood from leaking out. <text:s/>When the two of them got to the hospital Lyra quickly went over to the desk and started talking with the nurse. <text:s/>Wild explored the waiting area. <text:s/>It the standard for hospitals, a row of chairs along the wall, and posters of the various health and anatomy diagrams complete with a small selection of old magazines. <text:s/>For Wild though it was a strange mixture of emotions. <text:s/>She had not been to a hospital in longer than she could remember and it was a comforting reminder of before Blacklight when New York was still intact. <text:s/>However, she was also distinctly aware that being a virus a hospital was not exactly friendly territory and even more she could easily be revealed as an impostor.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T223">You friend seems fine, I&apos;m not sure why you are so agitated, Lyra.” <text:s/>the nurse said while approaching Wild. <text:s/>When Wild turned to face her though the nurse recanted, “Never mind. <text:s/>Ma&apos;am thats a lot of blood, you shouldn&apos;t be moving around so much. <text:s/>Let me just get you to an examination room where you can lay down.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T223">Wild went with the nurse and Lyra took a seat in the waiting room. <text:s/>The room had a single table and chair in it, as well as a sink in the corner. <text:s/>The cabinets under and around the sink were stocked with basic medical supplies while the same kinds of posters hung on the walls as in the waiting room. <text:s/>Seeing nothing wrong with the room Wild entered with the nurse. <text:s/>She did have to be coaxed onto the table though.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T224">Alright, I am nurse Redheart. <text:s/>Can you tell me about what brought you in today?” <text:s/>the cream </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T224">colored earth pony said as she collected materials for stitching wounds. <text:s/>Wild explained how she got stabbed and when Redheart commented on not seeing her before Wild also talked about being new to Ponyville. <text:s/>Redheart was concerned when she learned the green mare had been living outside of civilization for such a long time. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T28">Shit, she&apos;s getting suspicious, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T96">Wild worried, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T28">I was going to reveal myself anyway, but hospital worker was not my first choice. I think I need Lyra.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:span text:style-name="T225"><text:tab/>“Well, you shoulder is patched up,” Redheart stated she had done the stitches while Wild was distracted talking, “come back in five days and we can remove them. <text:s/>However, since you are new in town and don&apos;t have any medical records at all I must insist that just get a full check up and set of vaccinations. <text:s/>Please stay here while I go get the doctor.” <text:s/>Wild had begun fidgeting at that Redheart just assuming it was from the mention of needles. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T29">A full checkup at midnight with the on call doctor, that sounds reasonable. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T226">Wild pondered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T29">Yeah, she is past suspicious and is calling in backup. <text:s/>Running would only be a temporary delay. <text:s/>We&apos;re doing this live, good thing I got my own backup... Hopefully.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:span text:style-name="T29"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T226">The door closed behind Redheart and Wild started a ten count, letting the nurse get clear of the door. <text:s/>Rushing up to door, Wild quietly cracked it open to peek out. <text:s/>No nurses were visible, but the waiting room was since this was the first exam room. <text:s/>Catching Lyra&apos;s attention, Wild beckoned her over and the bemused mint mare walked over.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T227">You get your shoulder fixed?” Lyra asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T227">Yeah, but I think that Redheart is onto me.” Wild whispered which just confused Lyra more.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T227">What do you mean onto you? <text:s/>Wait, are you talking about the alien thing?” <text:s/>Lyra breathed now fully alert despite the time of day. <text:s/>“I thought you were joking. <text:s/>How did you sneak onto the planet? <text:s/>None of the other aliens got through without a government cover-up.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T228">I didn&apos;t sneak onto the planet, I was brought here.” Wild replied as they returned to the exam room. <text:s/>“But, right now I don&apos;t know what to do if Redheart finds out. <text:s/>I would rather not have to deal with being hunted.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T228">Right, got to keep you off the dissection table, and all.” <text:s/>Lyra deduced before asking, “Hey, if your an alien why do you look like an earth pony?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T228">Shape shifting. <text:s/>Can we come up with a plan before the Q&amp;A session.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T228">Ah, that part&apos;s easy. <text:s/>You came to the right mare, I&apos;m part of a group of... exotic citizens who would rather keep a low profile. <text:s/>Basically ponies in your situation, so don&apos;t worry I got this.” <text:s/>Lyra stated maintaining a professional tone for all of five seconds before bubbling, <text:s/>“First time we ever got to recruit an alien though.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T228">Wild paused at that revelation. <text:s/></text:span>“<text:span text:style-name="T228">This seems way too convenient.” she protested.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T228">Eh, not really, I had already figured you weren&apos;t a typical pony. <text:s/>The lack of a cutie mark kind a gives it away.” Lyra explained before frowning, <text:s/>“Thats probably why Martial is after you too. <text:s/>OK, this is going to be harder than I thought.” <text:s/>She then ask with a completely straight face, “Hey, do you have tentacles?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T30">Oh boy, I picked one weird pony to get help from, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T228">Wild mused before replying, “...No comment.” The two continued their question and answer session until a knock on the door sounded, before it opened and the doctor came in. <text:s/>The stallion had a light gray coat with a dark red mane and tail. <text:s/>A streak of white also ran through his mane, and on his sides rested two webbed wings. <text:s/>He even had slit pupils and small pair of fangs peeking out of his mouth. <text:s/>His cutie mark consisted of four tear drops of liquid with the colors black, yellow, red, and white that were position together to make a circle. <text:s/>Wild had no clue what to make of this new pony, and just watched him with a slight head tilt. </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T228">Hello, Miss Way and Lyra too. <text:s/>I shouldn&apos;t be surprised, you are always bring the most interesting ponies around.” <text:s/>the doctor greeted, “My name is Balanced Humors, and I shall be your physician tonight. <text:s/>I can see you have a question on your mind, don&apos;t worry many ponies do when they meet me, so go ahead and ask it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T229">Are you a pegasus?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T229">No, I am a thestral, essentially the bat counterpoint of pegasi. <text:s/>Usually ponies think I am a vampony.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T230">Nah, I don&apos;t buy it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T230">The doctor paused before letting out a hearty laugh, “That&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve met been with a flat refusal. <text:s/>Judging by the presence of Miss Lyra this looks to be an interesting &apos;checkup&apos;.” <text:s/>Shifting to a seat position he brought a hoof to his chin and continued, “Onto the reason why I&apos;m here, nurse Redheart suspected that you aren&apos;t as you appear, and it seems she was correct. <text:s/>In another ironic quirk, I find myself unsure what species you are. <text:s/>Despite popular opinion earth ponies and in fact all creatures have magic. <text:s/>That is except you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T231">I figured that you would notice. <text:s/>As far as I know everything from this world has magic, I am simply not f this world.” <text:s/>Wild said with a firmly neutral expression, “Out of curiosity was it just the lack of a cutie mark that gave it away.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T231">That was a major part of it, but no. <text:s/>Both the good nurse and I have some extra sense, ones which didn&apos;t work in the slightest with you. <text:s/>That was the main hint, the lack of cutie mark just let me figure out the why. <text:s/>It&apos;s purely magical, the only way you wouldn&apos;t have one is either not being a pony, not finding your talent, or not having magic. <text:s/>Obviously the first applies, but that last option is the only one that would explain you not showing up on our senses.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T232">Not as much as you might think. <text:s/>I made this body from pony DNA, it should be 100% earth pony with some cosmetic tweaks, but I don&apos;t know anything about magic.” <text:s/>Wild corrected. <text:s/>A cursory examination and round of shots, not even aliens could get out of them, and Wild was caught up with medical records. <text:s/>This was not the first time records were massaged for ponies that did not fit in the regular categories. <text:s/>Wild was just happy that she now had a more or less legitimate paper trail for herself. <text:s/>Lyra had fallen asleep, and was completely dead to the world so Wild ended up carrying Lyra back to her house after getting directions from the doctor. <text:s/>Her roommate was still waiting up for Lyra, but was understanding after a short explanation of the night&apos;s events.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P74" text:outline-level="1"><text:soft-page-break/>Chapter 5</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T233">Wild trotted down the road toward the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Entering the forest at night is inadvisable, but Wild Way could easily handle whatever she was likely to find. <text:s/>That was even her intent, after the encounter with Martial she decided it was time to bulk up. <text:s/>There was still a few hours of darkness, and she was on the hunt, preferably for something large and predatory. <text:s/>Figuring that none of the animals would be wary of a pony, her method of hunting was to loudly waltz around the forest like a fool until something ate her. <text:s/>A pretty quick and dirty plan, but one that will suit her needs.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T234">A manticore turned out to be the first taker and began following her after a while wandering aimlessly. <text:s/>Wild sensed the beast at about the same time as it found her, ironically both of them were smug about finding easy prey. <text:s/>A few minutes later and the manticore left with a full belly figuring it got to eat a foolish pony. <text:s/>A rare delicacy among Everfree carnivores, although the pony did not make as much noise as it expected. <text:s/>Walking back to its den the manticore got its first indication of a problem when it felt a sharp pain near its stomach. <text:s/>Within a minute the manticore lay dead on the ground with its former pride warily eying the scene. <text:s/>When the tendrils erupt from the corpse that was enough for the other manticores and the all scattered to the winds to avoid a similar fate.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T235">Wild got up from the ground as a black and red viral manticore. <text:s/>Stretching and walking around she examined her new body. <text:s/>Her limbs looked like some cross between braided black tendrils with a few red streaks along their surface and a chitinous claw with spikes at each of the joints. <text:s/>Her body was a bit more normal the fur was black and the flesh underneath an angry red randomly glaring out in spots. <text:s/>The wings and tail were unchanged aside from color still webbed bat wings and segmented scorpion like tail.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T236">OK</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T31">, two things, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97">Wild thought while heading back to Ponyville, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T34">Why</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T31"> does a mammal this large need venom, and this is the ugliest thing I have ever seen outside of the NYZ. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97">Not wanting to spend anymore time looking like this she shifted back to being a pony. <text:s/>This time though she a surplus of biomass to deal with. <text:s/>She increased the density of her bones and muscles as well as adding some more muscle mass. <text:s/>She also added a layer of fat to appear healthier, and not be hard enough to make rocks jealous. <text:s/>As an afterthought she also made a new set of stitches and bandage to replace the old ones still with her &apos;remains&apos;. <text:s/>The pair of bags always adorning her sides was also replaced and she was presentable once more.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T97"><text:tab/>Wanting to learn more about the manticores since she got the new form Wild decided to visit the Library. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T103">Crossed the boundary between the forest and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">apple </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T103">orchard i</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97">t was still too early </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T103">for the library to be open</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97">, the sun was only just rising on the horizon. <text:s/>Not having anything else to do she instead wandered to kill time. <text:s/>At first a only an occasional pony would ask about the bandage on her shoulder to which she would tell them a tame version of the events. <text:s/>By the time the library was open nearly everyone she passed </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T103">was </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97">express</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T103">ing</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97"> their condolences and reassurance that the rest of Ponyville was very accepting.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T97"><text:tab/>More than a bit </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">surprised</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97"> at the speed of gossip in small towns Wild knocked on the door to the library. <text:s/>Instead of the purple librarian she was meet by a large purple and green bipedal lizard. <text:s/>After </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T97">greeting him she found out that he was actually a dragon. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35">I did not expect a</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T31"> dragon in a library, maybe he doesn&apos;t breath fire, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97">Wild thought </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">worried about the possibility of fire</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">Skirting around the edge of the library she c</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97">ollect</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">ed</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97"> a</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">n</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97"> Everfree bestiary </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">and</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T97"> settled down for a day of learning.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T97"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">So manticore venom is paralytic, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T98">Wild mused reading through the section on manticores, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">and they use it to keep their food fresh... <text:s/>That&apos;s enough for that line of thought. <text:s/>Hmm, a paralytic could be useful beyond just poisoning things. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T98">While Wild was considering the possibilities, the door to the library gently opened to admit a yellow pegasus mare. <text:s/>She had a pastel pink mane, trio of butterflies for a cutie mark, and was urgently looking around the library.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:tab/>“Twilight,” she called loud enough for Wild to hear her, but nowhere near enough to be heard outside the room. <text:s/>Trotting in place she decided to venture deeper in to the library in search of the local librarian.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:tab/>Soon the pegasus and Twilight entered the main room. <text:s/>“What&apos;s wrong Fluttershy?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T98"><text:tab/>“Oh Twilight, its terrible, some pony was wandering in the Everfree forest last night </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T101">and I don&apos;t think they came back out</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T98">.” <text:s/>Fluttershy babbled, “I just don&apos;t know what to do. I was hoping that you might have some idea.” <text:s/>Both of the other ponies in the room were paying full attention, but for very different reasons.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T98"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">What the hell, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T98">Wild panicked, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">I can&apos;t imagine any other pony going into the forest, but how did she know about the manticore. <text:s/>This is bad, I figured nature would take care of the &apos;remains&apos;. <text:s/>OK, damage control time.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T32"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T98">Spike!” Twilight yelled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:tab/>“What is it, Twilight?” Spike returned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T98"><text:tab/>“I need you to take a letter.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T99">Twilight answered waiting just long enough for Spike to get a scroll and quill before dictating</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:tab/>“Dear Princess Celestia,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T98"><text:tab/>My friend Fluttershy and I are going into the Everfree forest </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T99">to... retrieve a lost pony that may have been attacked by a manticore.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>Your Most Faithful Student,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>Twilight Sparkle”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>“Are you really going into the Everfree, what if you get lost too?” <text:s/>Spike worried when he finished the letter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>“There&apos;s no time Spike we have to hurry.” Twilight stressed as she exited the library towing Fluttershy along with her. <text:s/>Figuring that the arguing was hopeless, Spike sent the letter praying that the princess would be able to handle this.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>In order to send the letter Spike used his flame breath enchanted to be able to send scroll to <text:soft-page-break/>distant ponies. <text:s/>The ash would fly away and be reconstructed into the original scroll when it reached the recipient. <text:s/>Unfortunately for her sake, Wild Way had a strong phobia of fire. <text:s/>However, fortunately for everyone else was distracted when she leapt to the roof and used her tendrils to cling on. <text:s/>Her presence of mind did not return until the reply scroll came in a burp of fire, and Spike began reading it aloud.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>“Dear Twilight,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>I trust your judgment, but please use caution both the Everfree forest and manticores are not something to take lightly. <text:s/>I will also be sending a specialist to assist either in the actual retrieval of the missing pony, or in returning the pony to their home, as the case may be.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T237">Sincerely,</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T237">Princess Celestia,” Spike finished before running to the door.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T237">After dropping to the ground while Spike was turned away Wild called out, </text:span>“<text:span text:style-name="T237">Wait, I can take that letter for you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T237">Spike stopped to consider the offer, but rebutted, “I can&apos;t ask you to go into the Everfree.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T237">You don&apos;t need to worry about me, I&apos;ve made it through worse things.” <text:s/>Wild reassured with a smile that in no way reflected her emotions. “The library also needs someone to runs things, and I promise I will keep Twilight safe.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T237">Alright, since you promise.” Spike gave in with a brave facade. “I will make sure the library is running smoothly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T237">Taking the scroll in her mouth, Wild put it in her bags and left the library. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T33">Good, I&apos;ve got a reason to join Twilight&apos;s mission, now I just need a reason why my partially eaten corpse is lying around in the Everfree. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T100">She groaned mentally, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T33">Also, a princess is involved. <text:s/>Why did a princess have to be involved. <text:s/>I wonder what Lyra will think of this. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T100">She added in while hurrying down the road to catch up with the <text:s/>pair of would-be rescuers.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25"><text:tab/>Wild caught up to the pair not far into the forest to their surprise. <text:s/>Twilight asked, “Wild Way what are you doing here.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T100"><text:tab/>“I came to give you the reply from the princess.” <text:s/>Wild stated before grabbing the letter out of her bag. <text:s/>Twilight took it and read the entire thing out loud. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T101">Well, it&apos;s dangerous to be alone in the Everfree, you should come with us Wild.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T101"><text:tab/>The trio proceed deeper into the forest, Wild was confident that she could handle any trouble, but the other two were </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T102">much more tense. <text:s/>Wild was much less confident with how things would go when the reached her body. <text:s/>“Hey Fluttershy, how did you know that someone got lost in the forest?” Wild inquired figuring she could at least find out how to avoid being detected next time.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P26"><text:tab/>“Oh, my animal friends saw them go in but not come out.” Fluttershy squeaked the low volume not a problem for Wild&apos;s hearing.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T102"><text:tab/>“Ah, they sound pretty helpful.” <text:s/>Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T103">said while thinking, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T34">She created a town wide fuzzy spy </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T34">network, and probably doesn&apos;t even realize it. <text:s/>Although, they didn&apos;t notice me passing through that orchard. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T103">Wild waited a little before her next question, “Hey girls, what if this pony is in more than one piece?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T103"><text:tab/>Oddly Twilight was the only one to react strongly, Fluttershy just looked saddened. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t even want to think about that, but we will bring them back to Ponyville.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T104">Twilight declared just managing to keep a hold on her breakfast.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T104"><text:tab/>The scent of blood reached the ponies causing two of them to sprint ahead, Wild reluctantly kept up with them. <text:s/>Already knowing the general state of the body she was more interesting in the reactions, specifically Twilights. <text:s/>Twilights had visibly paled at the sight, her eyes shrunken to pinpricks, and already </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T105">hyperventilating.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T104"> <text:s/>“Are you going to be alright, Twilight?” Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T105">worried</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T104">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T104"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T105">Twilight turned to reply, but instead of words Wild got a up close look at what Twilight had for breakfast. <text:s/>Twilight ended up on the ground in a dead faint. <text:s/>“Right, I&apos;ll just take that as a no.” Wild deadpanned while creating a rag to clean herself off. <text:s/>“I probably deserved </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T106">that</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T105">.” she mumbled </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T106">and lifted Twilight onto her back. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T107">Turning back to Fluttershy Wild saw that the yellow pegasus was looking slowing looking between the body and Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T107"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T108">Um, if you don&apos;t mind me asking why do you look </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T110">just</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T108"> like this poor pony?” <text:s/>Fluttershy asked long after the silence became awkward.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T108"><text:tab/>After a few false starts Wild bit the bullet and answer, “Well, you see it was my body.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T109">Pawing at the ground and looking everywhere but at Fluttershy, “Sorry for making you come into the Everfree, but I didn&apos;t know what to do.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T109"><text:tab/>“Oh don&apos;t worry about it, I </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T110">forgive you.” <text:s/>Fluttershy cooed</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27"><text:tab/>“You are taking all of this surprisingly well” <text:s/>Wild observed and looked back at the unconscious <text:s/>unicorn on her back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T110"><text:tab/>“Oh, you just somewhat remind me of my animal friends. <text:s/>Not that I think you are an animal or anything.” <text:s/>Fluttershy </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T111">confessed with a blush.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28"><text:tab/>“Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m not insulted. <text:s/>You are more right than you think. <text:s/>While not living like an wild animal, I didn&apos;t really live like a pony.” Wild tapered off. <text:s/>She was rather surprised when a pair of forelegs wrapped around her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T111"><text:tab/>“You made it to Ponyville, you don&apos;t have to live like that anymore.” Fluttershy soothed. <text:s/>Even though Wild already knew that hearing it from someone else made it sink in. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T112">Soon a few drops of liquid landed on Fluttershy&apos;s back as her hug was returned. The moment lasted until Twilight started to stir.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29"><text:tab/>“Welcome back Twilight, you might not want to look around too much.” <text:s/>Wild suggested.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29"><text:tab/>“What did I miss?” Twilight asked still groggy from her impromptu nap.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29"><text:tab/>“Not much I just identified the body.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T112"><text:tab/>“The body?” <text:s/>Twilight </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T113">repeated before gasping, “Oh my gosh, that poor pony, and all I did was </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T113">throw up. Oh no, I am so sorry Wild Way.” <text:s/>Twilight had hopped to the ground and began pacing.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“Twilight! Calm down, I already cleaned up the vomit and its not a big a deal.” <text:s/>Wild exclaimed, “This is a little awkward, but the body is actually mine. Sorry about making you trek through the Everfree.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“What?” Twilight blurted out and inspected the body, “but thats not possible, you are there so you can&apos;t be over there...”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>Wild grabbed Twilight to break her out of her rambling before explaining, “So I am not exactly what you might call a normal pony. <text:s/>Among other things I can regenerate myself from even a small part of my body.” <text:s/>Wild pawed at the ground to stall, before continuing “So, the less than complete me is from yesterday, and I am regenerated from the... missing pieces.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“Missing... oh... Oh gross.” <text:s/>Twilight grimaced while Wild just shrugged. <text:s/>“Wait in order to do that you would need to get material from somewhere.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“Well, that is true, but are you sure you want to continue that line of reasoning.” <text:s/>Wild confirmed hoping that Twilight would not react too poorly. <text:s/>There is no way that she could resist thinking about an unsolved mystery.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“Ah, you used the food that the animal ate.” <text:s/>Twilight deduced even Fluttershy raised an eyebrow at that.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>“Was it at least quick?” <text:s/>Fluttershy questioned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:span text:style-name="T113"><text:tab/>“Yes, only a few seconds.” <text:s/>Wild answered receiving a nod from Fluttershy. <text:s/>A large shadow was the only warning the ponies got before a large form dropped out of the sky </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T114">grab, the partial pony body and flew away. <text:s/>“Right, we should go back to Ponyville.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31"><text:tab/>On the way back Twilight asked, “Wild Way, why did you think you needed to keep your abilities?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60"><text:span text:style-name="T114"><text:tab/>“Simply put, I was afraid of how you would react. <text:s/>The abilities I have are terrifying, they go far beyond just regeneration. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T115">I wasn&apos;t the only one who got them, everyone else considered us monsters. <text:s/>For good reason too.” Wild lamented before scrunching her muzzle in thought. <text:s/>She decided to risk it and pleaded, “I knew I wouldn&apos;t be able to keep it secret, nor do I really want to. <text:s/>I hope that you two will keep this part secret.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P32"><text:tab/>Letting out a breath before confessing, “I am a virus.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60"><text:span text:style-name="T115"><text:tab/>“You&apos;re a... </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T117">what</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T115">, how would that even work?” <text:s/>Twilight inquire</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T116">d </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T117">skeptical of Wild&apos;s claim</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T115">. <text:s/>Fluttershy was still patiently listening her expression remaining unchanged throughout the whole conversation.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60"><text:span text:style-name="T115"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T116">I am not entirely sure. <text:s/>I used to be a person same as </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T124">anyone</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T116"> before I was infected. <text:s/>After the virus ran its course I ended up in control with the same mind as before. <text:s/>I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m a mass of infected cells with control over the infection, or the infection itself.” Wild mused focusing on </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T116">explaining instead of what she was explaining, “I&apos;m not sure it matters either.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60"><text:span text:style-name="T116"><text:tab/>Twilight&apos;s brow furrowed as she digested the wealth of information allowing Fluttershy fill the lull. <text:s/>“Well I know that you aren&apos;t a monster. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T117">You didn&apos;t follow us into the Everfree forest to protect your secret, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">after all</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T117"> did you.” <text:s/>Now two of the ponies were lost in thought </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">on their forest trek</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T117">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P78" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 6</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P61"><text:span text:style-name="T117"><text:tab/>The ponies </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">ended up </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T117">exit</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">ing</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T117"> the Everfree forest near Fluttershy&apos;s cottage. <text:s/>Saying goodbye Fluttershy returned to home to take care of her animal friends. <text:s/>Twilight had been giving Wild what she thought were discrete looks. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">Wild pretended not to notice in wondering what Twilight was working up to.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Wild Way, can I ask you a personal question?” Twilight pleaded even using puppy dog eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Sure, there&apos;s no need to stop now.” <text:s/>Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“How do you function?” <text:s/>Twilight asked before she rephrased it as, “I mean, how does your regeneration work?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“All of my abilities aren&apos;t truly abilities but different ways I can exploit the fact that I am a network of connected infected cells that I can control on a genetic level.” <text:s/>Wild explained enjoying the chance to share knowledge with someone, “The regeneration is literally just moving the cells back into place and growing more as needed.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“You&apos;re a gestalt” Twilight started before the explanation fully set in. <text:s/>She exclaimed, “You can control your genetics, the potential of that is...” <text:s/>Twilight trailed off as she imagined the possibilities.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P61"><text:span text:style-name="T118"><text:tab/>Wild decided to rescue Twilight from her own mind. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35">This is such a terrible idea, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">Wild admitted <text:s/>as she approached Twilight, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35">but its been so long since I got to prank someone</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118">. <text:s/>“I could even do something like this...”, Wild smirked and gently touched Twilight&apos;s foreleg. <text:s/>As she returned her own foreleg to the ground she began shifting. <text:s/>She kept the tendrils to a minimum, but Twilight was still disturbed by the act. <text:s/>After only a few seconds there were two Twilights standing just outside the Everfree forest.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Wild...” Twilight stammered surprised to see her own face in gray, “why are you gray?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>Inspecting a foreleg, Wild found that she was in fact an entirely gray Twilight. <text:s/>“I have no idea, I should be a clone of you.” she confessed worrying that there might be something wrong with her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“A clone, but the only time a pony would be that gray is if their magic is almost completely gone.” Twilight thought out loud intent on solving this mystery. <text:s/>“Oh no, you didn&apos;t use up all of your magic, did you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>Relieved that the problem was just a lack of magic. <text:s/>“Ponies coat color are based on magic?” Wild chuckled, “that explains it, I don&apos;t have any magic.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“No magic” <text:s/>Twilight gasped and tried to pull Wild with her, “we need to get you to the hospital <text:soft-page-break/>before magic exhaustion sets in.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>Rolling her eyes Wild held Twilight&apos;s head still as she explained, “Twilight, I&apos;ll be fine I never had magic to begin with.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:span text:style-name="T118"><text:tab/>“What” Twilight bleated and went catatonic. <text:s/>Wild tried waving her leg in front of Twilight and calling her name but got no response.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35"> <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T36">Damn, I did it again, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T119">Wild thought with a sigh.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T118"> <text:s/>Reverting to her own form Wild headed back to the library with Twilight once more on her back. <text:s/>Once she got within sight of the library she saw a golden armored white unicorn giving her a bemused look.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“Ma&apos;am, why do you have Twilight Sparkle on your back?” <text:s/>the stallion asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m hoping her assistant knows how to wake her up, so I&apos;m bringing her back to the library.” <text:s/>Wild said stopping to talk to this new pony.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“I was informed that she and Fluttershy would be searching for a missing pony, I take that she went on ahead and ended up in this state?” he inquired his expression making it clear he wanted an answer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:span text:style-name="T118"><text:tab/>“She did, but this state was a result of learning an odd piece of information.” Wild replied more amused than intimidated by the unicorn. <text:s/>“Also can we move this to the library?” <text:s/>she requested. <text:s/>The stallion did not see a problem with it so the pair relocated to the Golden Oaks library. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T119">Spike greeted them when they entered, but applied his hand to his forehead when he saw Twilight.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“What happened this time?” Spike asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“Well, I just told her that I don&apos;t have any magic and then this.” <text:s/>Wild said indicating her insensate passenger.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:span text:style-name="T119"><text:tab/>“What?” both of the males deadpanned. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T120">After a pause to let that sink in Spike continued, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T119">“Well, that would do it </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T120">luckily its pretty easy to get her out of this state. <text:s/>Twilight, you&apos;re going to be late if you stay like that.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:span text:style-name="T120"><text:tab/>Almost before he finished saying the woods Twilight began freaking out. <text:s/>“Late, no no no no no, I can&apos;t be late, I&apos;ve got-- Um, wait, when did we get to the library and why am I on your back Wild Way?” <text:s/>Twilight spew out and wiggled her hoo</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T121">ve</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T120">s uselessly until she noticed her position and hopped down to the floor.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:span text:style-name="T120"><text:tab/>“I carried you here when you froze after I told...” Wild managed to get out before </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T121">her brain caught up</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T120">, “you some stuff.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:span text:style-name="T120"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T121">O...Kay”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Also, a golden armored pony is here” Wild announced and looked over to the boys before continuing, “You&apos;re here for the missing pony thing, right?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Yes.” the stallion answered, “I am Special Agent Lucent Lodestar, the golden armored pony sent to aid in the search and rescue.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“I apologize for my friend here”, Twilight said before sending a glare to Wild. <text:s/>Wild just averted her eyes, so Twilight continued, “As for the missing pony, well there is no longer a missing pony.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:span text:style-name="T55"><text:tab/>“That&apos;s an interesting way to phrase that, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T124">what happened to the missing pony?</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T55">”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:span text:style-name="T55"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T124">A</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T55"> giant brown thing ate the corpse.” Wild supplied. <text:s/>Twilight&apos;s face and hooves met as she groaned. <text:s/>Lucent had a raised eyebrow, and spike was wide eyed prompting Wild to reassure, “Don&apos;t worry no one was hurt.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:span text:style-name="T55"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T122">So, your story is that there was a corpse that got eaten by a roc, but no one was hurt. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T123">That&apos;s not the most believable story.” Lucent critiqued.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:span text:style-name="T123"><text:tab/>“But it is technically correct.” Twilight deadpanned, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T124">do you really have to answer questions so candidly?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:span text:style-name="T124"><text:tab/>“Yes” Wild answered her stance stiffening causing Lucent to narrow his eyes. <text:s/>Twilight just huffed </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T125">and recounted the events leaving out that Wild had originally been the corpse and how she managed to </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T126">escape</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T125"> the manticore. <text:s/>Lucent or course wanted to know why she needed a manticore.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:span text:style-name="T125"><text:tab/>“I have only been in Ponyville for a couple days, but I like to be prepared for threats. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T126">The Everfree happens to contain a lot of different threats.” <text:s/>Wild explained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“That is one way to learn about threatening creatures, I would advise a book next time though.” <text:s/>Lucent retorted no longer certain of the sanity of this mare.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Sorry for making you come all the way out here for nothing.” <text:s/>Twilight apologized.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:span text:style-name="T126"><text:tab/>“Don&apos;t worry about it, just learning about that roc sighting makes it worth it, but I&apos;m here to find out about a oddly large number of incidents in the past couple days.” <text:s/>Lucent reassured as he pulled out a list, “Let&apos;s see there a break in by a shadowy figure,” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T37">Shit, I knew that would come back, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T126">Wild thought</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T37">,</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T126"> “a full grown pony lacking a cutie mark wandered into town, a mare reported being stalked, said stalker was later arrested after stabbing the mare,” Twilight gasp and eyed Wild&apos;s bandage, “a pony devoid of magic was discovered at the hospital,” Twilight mumbled something about being impossible, <text:s/>“and finally a mare is reported lost in the Everfree forest.” <text:s/>Lucent finished and put away his list before asking Wild, “How many of these involve you miss Wild Way?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“All of them.” Wild squeaked out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Why were you sneaking into someones bedroom?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“To tap them on the shoulder.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“...Alright, thats enough for today. <text:s/>Ladies it was nice to meet you, and Miss Way you live an interesting life, the royal guard might contact you in the future.” <text:s/>Lucent declared before leaving the library. <text:s/>The two mares waved until he left.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“You broke into someones house?!” Twilight hissed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“I needed a DNA sample and its not like I just go and ask.” Wild defended.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>Unable to come up with a counter argument Twilight asked, “Where did Spike go?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“The kitchen, it is around lunch time I think,” Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Hey, you should stay for lunch.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Uh, OK.” <text:s/>Wild conceded and followed the smaller mare into the kitchen. <text:s/>Spike had actually expected the possibility of an extra guest so there was plenty of food. <text:s/>Twilight practically inhaled hers until she notice the stares. <text:s/>She blushed and decided to eat more calmly after that. <text:s/>Wild did her best to keep herself as far from Spike as she could, but eventually her fidgeting was noticed by Twilight.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Wild, whats wrong, you have been fidgeting like you need to use the bathroom for a while now?” <text:s/>Twilight worried.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:span text:style-name="T126"><text:tab/>“Bathroom?” Wild repeated, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T37">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T126">Yes, I need to use the bathroom?” <text:s/>She got up and rushed off waiting just long enough to hear the location of the bathroom. <text:s/>Closing the door she set about her task of collecting water from the largest body of it in the room. <text:s/>Unfortunately the excess splashing attracted the attention of Twilight who came into the room to investigate.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Wild what are you doing in--” Twilight began while her brain took a couple seconds to process the scene. <text:s/>“WHAT ARE YOU DOING THATS NOT HOW YOU USE A TOILET!” Twilight shouted with head pulled back in disgust. <text:s/>Wild Way was sitting in front of the toilet staring at Twilight with eyes wide open and body frozen in fear at being caught. <text:s/>Wild&apos;s head was lowered partially into the toilet bowl, and her foreleg was jammed into the drain far enough that her hoof was not visible. <text:s/>The other foreleg extended toward the handle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>The two were both at a loss on how to react to the other. <text:s/>Spike just yelled, “I&apos;M NOT CLEANING IT!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“This is exactly what it looks like.” Wild blurted now that Spike had broken the ice.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“I don&apos;t know what this looks like!” Twilight returned. <text:s/>“Don&apos;t flush it like that!” Twilight added when she saw a foreleg continue its journey.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“I need water, and this is the fastest way.” Wild explained before quickly flushing the toilet. <text:s/>Against Twilights expectation the water rushed into the bowl, but the level never rose instead seeming to disappear when it hit the foreleg clogging the bowl. <text:s/>Once the toilet was done flushing Wild pulled out her foreleg and flushed it one more time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>Twilight watched the whole process both intrigued and grossed out with it. <text:s/>Once it was complete she asked, “Why did you need so much water?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Afraid” Wild mumbled turning away from the purple mare.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Afraid of what?” Twilight prompted softer this time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:span text:style-name="T55"><text:tab/>“Fire” was the barely audible reply that Twilight got. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T127">I have pyrophobia turns out regeneration and fire are not a great combination. <text:s/>Anyway, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T128">I find having water nearby comforting I just needed a little more.” <text:s/>Wild confessed regaining confidence through the whole thing, “Don&apos;t worry too much </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T128">about it, this is my problem to deal with.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“You can rely on friends to help you, so don&apos;t feel obligated to do it all yourself.” Twilight protested, “Also, 3 gallons is not a little. <text:s/>I don&apos;t even know where you fit all of that.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“The fear is manageable for now.” Wild dismissed, “As for where the water is, well its not like I need all those vital organs. <text:s/>I&apos;m almost literally a walking water balloon.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>Twilight tried to hold a stern expression but relented to the absurdity of the pony in front of her. <text:s/>The girls moved to the main room to see Spike there who promptly grimaced and said, “I do not want to know what you two were doing in there.” <text:s/>The two of them just broke down into laughter when they realized what parts of the conversation Spike had heard. <text:s/>From there things returned to normal for the library with Wild returning to her book. <text:s/>It only took her another hour or so to finished it and absorb all of the information.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>Wild said goodbye to the library pair and set off into the town. <text:s/>She decided that after the events of today the only reasonable course of action would be to lazy around at the park. <text:s/>Picking a nice out of the way spot she settled down to watch the clouds. <text:s/>A completely mundane and not at all dangerous activity just like she wanted. <text:s/>Most of the afternoon passed while ponies played around her, but eventually darker clods started getting pushed around the sky. <text:s/>All of the other ponies had left by then, except Wild who was distracted by the pegasi flitting around the darkening clouds.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:span text:style-name="T128"><text:tab/>Wild was a bit confused when she found herself upside down in a large depression a few yards from where she was sitting. <text:s/>It had happened so fast that she didn&apos;t notice, but lightning had discharged from the clouds above her and since the area was clear of trees there was only one likely target. <text:s/>The lightning strike had caused her muscles to contract, her legs to extends and since she was laying on her belly, her entire body was flung into the sky. <text:s/>She reached the height of a three story building at the apex of her flight and caught the attention of all the nearby pegasi. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T129">Her trip finished with loud thud as she landed sending grass and dirt flying.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>As Wild stood up she saw a lilac pegasus broke away from the clouds a swoop down moving her mouth as if talking. <text:s/>Wild took a second to realize her own hearing was the problem and said “Hold on Flitter, my hearing isn&apos;t back yet.” <text:s/>Taking stock of herself Wild found that along with the hearing issue she had some superficial scarring and a her shoulder had reopened. <text:s/>She shook off the accumulated dirt and soot on her coat while healing her scarred back. <text:s/>Repairing her eardrum she was finally able to hear Flitter&apos;s frantic words. <text:s/>Understanding them was a different matter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“Flitter, I can&apos;t understand you unless you slow down.” <text:s/>Wild said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>Taking a breath Flitter was able to get out, “Wild, you shouldn&apos;t be moving, and your bleeding and we need to get you to the hospital.” <text:s/>Flitter had been inspecting Wild for injuries, then switched to trying to push her to the hospital.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:span text:style-name="T129"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T130">I&apos;m fine.” Wild protested, “See just a little blood, nothing to worry about.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“Nope, you are going to the hospital, and that blood it from your pulled stitches.” <text:s/>Flitter <text:soft-page-break/>countered and herded the larger mare away. <text:s/>Wild grumbled, but went along with it anyway. <text:s/>The doctor visit went smoothly with Doctor Humor. <text:s/>He did comment on the several hundred pound weight increase, but did not dig deeper considering his patient&apos;s nature. <text:s/>Redoing the stitches he sent the mares on the way.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Not convinced, but not willing to contradict the doctor Flitter compromised on taking Wild Way to her house for overnight observation. <text:s/>Wild had little say in this decision, not that she really minded though.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P79" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 7</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Flitter was the first one awake the next day and entered the living room to check on Wild. <text:s/>Wild was laying on the couch head on one of the arm rest and legs folded up beneath her. <text:s/>As Flitter approached Wild woke up too.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“Sorry, didn&apos;t mean to wake you.” Flitter apologized.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“It&apos;s about time to wake up anyway, and I&apos;m a very light sleeper.” <text:s/>Wild moved off the couch and yawned, “Thanks for letting me stay the night, being outside in that storm would have been a bad idea.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“I still can&apos;t believe that you got struck by lightning.” <text:s/>Flitter said then frowned as a thought came to her, “What do you mean being outside in the storm?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“Oh, I would have found something to bed down in, but all the rain would get annoying.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Flitter eyes widened and mouth opened as comprehension dawned on her. <text:s/>She whispered, “Thats why you always have those bags with you. <text:s/>You&apos;re homeless, aren&apos;t you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Wild just shrugged, “I&apos;m used to it at this point, I haven&apos;t had a home in years.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“You idiot, you should have told someone. <text:s/>With all of the injuries you get, its a miracle your still alive.” <text:s/>Flitter shouted. <text:s/>An almost awake Cloud Chaser stumbled into the room to observe the argument.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“Its not so bad, its like camping. <text:s/>Also, I am very difficult to kill. <text:s/>It would take a little more than some lightning to do me in.” <text:s/>Wild assured, but Flitter&apos;s eye twitch indicated that her words did not have the intended effect.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“That&apos;s not like camping at all.” Flitter scolded, “Should have had the doctor check your brain too. <text:s/>And just what do you mean difficult to kill?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m not exactly a normal pony, look even that lightning bolt barely did anything to me.” Wild pleaded prompting Flitter to approach. <text:s/>She looked for any obvious injuries and finding none started poking Wild in the side to check for less obvious ones. <text:s/>Her muzzle scrunched up, and one eye squinted as she stepped back.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Chuckling Cloud Chaser added, “So you are the one that got hit by that bolt. <text:s/>I&apos;m not surprised <text:soft-page-break/>she took it without injury Flitter, she did hop off the roof she was sleeping on like it was nothing. <text:s/>Even landed light as a feather, too. <text:s/>Of course you&apos;re not a normal pony, you&apos;re a secret agent ninja pony.” <text:s/>She finished with a raised hoof as a flourish.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“You knew she was sleeping on the streets and didn&apos;t say anything.” Flitter seethed turning her ire on her sister.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>“Oh, look at the time. <text:s/>I think I hear breakfast calling.” <text:s/>Cloud blurted out before she and Wild scurried out of the room. <text:s/>Flitter followed them mumbling under her breath about strangling the other two ponies.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:span text:style-name="T130"><text:tab/>Once breakfast was finished, Flitter apologized, “I&apos;m sorry for </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T131">getting so puchy with you Wild. <text:s/>I just worry about you getting hurt. <text:s/>Uh, more hurt.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:span text:style-name="T131"><text:tab/>“Aw, come here you.” Wild cooed while pulling Flitter into a hug, “I&apos;m sorry for worrying you, I just haven&apos;t had anyone worry about me in a long time.” <text:s/>Wild then leaned in </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T132">to whisper, “Though, even that lightning was barely enough to injure me.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Cloud Chaser agreed, “Yep, she&apos;s a ninja, but seriously how did you manage to get hit by lightning anyway. <text:s/>We don&apos;t let enough charge build up in the clouds to arc that far.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Wild shrugged, “Maybe it accumulated from nearby clouds.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“Well, there will probably be an investigation on it, but we need to get to work.” Cloud said</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“And if you need a place to sleep then feel free to come by.” Flitter added, before the three went there separate ways. Wild headed off to find Lyra figuring that she would probably be interested in the recent events. <text:s/>Lyra had already left by the time Wild made it to her house, but asking around she found <text:s/>out Lyra usually hangs around the park. <text:s/>Getting to the park it was easy to find the mint mare playing her lyre.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“Well if it isn&apos;t the talk of the town.” Lyra greeted once she finished her song, “You competing with Twilight and her gang or something?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“I don&apos;t think so, what did Twilight do?” Wild inquired.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“The early morning after she first got here she takes on a living legend. <text:s/>Nightmare Moon payed a visit to town, and Twilight just wanders through the Everfree and defeats her. <text:s/>That was only the day before you got here and Ponyville has been a lot more interesting since then. <text:s/>Anyway, what brings you out here?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“A few things actually, but first I assume you&apos;ve heard that I took a lightning bolt last night and won?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Lyra snorted at that and said, “Yeah, though you wouldn&apos;t guess from the looks of you. <text:s/>From what I heard you got some serious air time as well. <text:s/>The town is split on whether you are some kind of super-pony, or some kind of monster. <text:s/>So, trying to be discrete is out the window, and from what it sounds like you are already being hunted. <text:s/>Ponies don&apos;t just get struck with lightning.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>Wild mulled that over, “Well, whichever the town chooses they won&apos;t be wrong. <text:s/>Huh, adjusting to controlled weather is weird. <text:s/>You&apos;re theory is that there&apos;s a conspiracy to kill me.” <text:s/>Wild earned a slap on the shoulder for that, but just grinned and continued, “Any idea who?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Lyra sighed, “My guess is Martial&apos;s group, the <text:span text:style-name="T241">Itinerant Keeper</text:span>s. <text:s/>An old group nearly from the founding of Equestria. <text:s/>They&apos;re pretty much pony supremacists, all that hostility had to go to something when the tree tribes united after all. <text:s/>Usually they focus on wild creatures, but they seem to have taken an interest in you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“They&apos;re aren&apos;t the only ones, Twilight and Fluttershy know about me, and the royal <text:span text:style-name="T241">guard</text:span> is al<text:span text:style-name="T241">so</text:span> poking around now.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Lyra laughed, “You haven&apos;t even been here a full week and already you&apos;ve got the attention of the royal guard. <text:s/>You are not very good at secrets, are you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“You have no idea, and I have no idea what I am doing.” Wild grumbled, “I was hoping you might have some insight.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Lyra rubbed her chin and mused, “Hmm, the town and royal guard will do their own thing, just don&apos;t be a bad pony and it should sort itself out. <text:s/>The <text:span text:style-name="T241">Keepers</text:span> though are a problem. <text:s/>They are one of the biggest problems for our group, I&apos;m conscripting you by the way, and we&apos;ve always just avoided them. <text:s/>You however are on a collision course with them and I don&apos;t know what will happen. <text:s/>I&apos;ve wanted to be more public with things but it was never worth the risk. <text:s/>You&apos;re going to be a trailblazer for us, I hope you&apos;re prepared for a fight.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Dropping her face into her hooves Wild groaned, “I&apos;m not a fighter, I just <text:span text:style-name="T241">happen to be very hard to kill</text:span>.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“That will have to be good enough, there aren&apos;t really many pony fighters to get experience from. <text:s/>Although Twilight has connections with the princess. <text:s/>You might be able to get a better solution there to this clandestine organization issue.” said Lyra as she picked up her lyre again. <text:s/>Lyra began playing and provided a nice background while Wild thought over all the new information. <text:s/>Giving into the soothing music Wild relaxed and watched the ponies in the park, until Lyra started packing up to leave.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>“Oh, and there&apos;s a meeting in a couple days, I&apos;ll bring you along, OK?” <text:s/>Lyra asked. <text:s/>Wild agreed and Lyra headed off to her next destination. <text:s/>Not long after Lyra left a pair of young unicorns approached Wild stopping about a yard away.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:span text:style-name="T132"><text:tab/>One of them began to whisper, “She doesn&apos;t look like a monster, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">just a blank flank</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T132">.” </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:span text:style-name="T132"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">Maybe if we throw a rock at her she&apos;ll turn into a monster.” <text:s/>The other suggested.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:span text:style-name="T133"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">Well they are straight forward at least, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">Wild thought, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">a bit dumb though. <text:s/>I hope they don&apos;t go monster hunting in the Everfree forest. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">The one that had made the suggestion had already found a rock and was returning. <text:s/>He threw it at Wild as soon as he made it back to his friend. <text:s text:c="2"/>Wild had no problem catching the rock before it hit her despite the fact that the kids had been behind her. <text:s/>Tossing the rock </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T133">away, Wild got up and headed over to the pair of stunned foals.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“What are you two doing?” Wild demanded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“We heard that you were a monster in disguise.” <text:s/>The taller one answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“Yeah, we had to see. <text:s/>So can you show us?” <text:s/>The portly one added.<text:tab/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:span text:style-name="T133"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">I feel sorry for their parents, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">Wild thought as she recovered from the idiocy. <text:s/>Wild decided to humor them, its not like anyone would believe these two. <text:s/>“Well, I suppose I am a shape shifter. Though I don&apos;t think that makes me a monster.” <text:s/>Wild corrected before shifting her eyes and teeth to a house cat version. <text:s/>“Alright there you go.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P45"><text:tab/>“Cool, she is a monster.” cheered the taller one.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P45"><text:tab/>“I know, I bet none of the other towns have their own monsters.” gushed the other one as the pair rushed off. <text:s/>Wild reverted her features.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68"><text:span text:style-name="T133"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">Well, there they go to add more rumor to mill, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T133">Wild smirked, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">Should be enough </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T39">theories </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T38">now that no one will actually believe any of them. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T134">The day progressed uneventfully until the late afternoon. <text:s/>Wild had decided to stop at the fountain in the town square. She was sitting on the ground with her back against the edge of the fountain when a pony walked near by and dropped an object in her lap. <text:s/>Looking down to see what it was she found a baseball sized metal ball with a lattice of grooves cut into it. <text:s/>One end of it had an extension with a mouth grip and lever clearly marking it as a grenade.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>“Oh fuck, its a bomb!” Wild yelled to the ponies still in the square and grabbed the grenade. <text:s/>Most were already home, so the square was mostly empty, but a few stragglers remained for one reason or another. <text:s/>“Everyone run away!” <text:s/>Wild ordered since not all of the townsfolk understood the first. <text:s/>That got them moving mostly in the right direction.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68"><text:span text:style-name="T134"><text:tab/>S</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T39">hit this is going to hurt, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T134">Wild thought as she shoved the grenade down her throat. <text:s/>From the memories of an inattentive Blackwatch soldier she knew that the shrapnel would easily rip through the ponies still nearby. <text:s/>She went with the simplest solution using her own body to absorb the fragments. <text:s/>Just a second after the grenade hit her stomach it went off. <text:s/>The sound was only slightly muffled and caused all the ponies in the square to drop to the ground on instinct. <text:s/>The ones still in the square and closest to the fountain felt themselves get hit with something and warm liquid started trailing down their bodies, one got hit hard enough by one of the larger projectiles to have the breath knock out of her. <text:s/>At least one minute passed before anyone was willing to move.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>The first to see the scene were the guards despite not being present at the time. <text:s/>Most of them emptied their stomachs when they got their first glimpse. <text:s/>Unidentifiable bits of flesh were strewn over the square on one side of the fountain along with blood splatter. <text:s/>Unfortunately the ponies still in the square were not spared and would see that they too were covered in viscera once that stopped cowering. <text:s/>A few of the larger mass could be recognized as organ including the one that knocked the breath out of a mare. <text:s/>The worst part was Wild herself. <text:s/>Her entire chest cavity was missing only her ribs remaining. <text:s/>Her head was forced up by the blast and blood could be seen oozing out of the mouth <text:soft-page-break/>as it limply rested on the fountains edge. <text:s/>Her limbs were mostly intact, though one foreleg hung by a thread and a hind leg was clearly bent the wrong way. <text:s/>Her ever present bags where the only thing untouched by the explosion</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>After recovering the guards helped the ponies around the square to the hospital. <text:s/>They left the body of the obviously dead mare at the center of the explosion. <text:s/>No hospital could do anything for her after all. <text:s/>As with all such events spectators began showing up and soon a ring of horrified ponies formed around the square kept back by some of the local guards. <text:s/>At the front of the crowd Wild&apos;s friends had gathered along with a cream color earth pony mare with a blue and pink mane. <text:s/>She had a trio of candies on her flank. <text:s/>They were all commenting about the tragedy except for Twilight Sparkle.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>Twilight countered, “I don&apos;t think she&apos;s dead.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>Along with the crowd the nearest guard reasoned, “Ma&apos;am, I don&apos;t think any pony could survive missing all their organs.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>Twilight continued, “She isn&apos;t exactly a pony though, and this isn&apos;t the first time she&apos;s lost her organs.” <text:s/>Twilight managed to keep her lunch down as she guessed, “I think she&apos;s just disoriented, and will start moving again at some point.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>“You saying she&apos;s a zombie.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>“Of course not. <text:s/>Zombies aren&apos;t real.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>While Twilight was arguing with the guard Wild was actually recovering just as Twilight said. <text:s/>First she fixed her senses but could only hear the surrounding ponies as her view was of the sky and she couldn&apos;t yet move her head. <text:s/>The first indication that ponies got of anything strange was a loud wet popping sound from Wild&apos;s hind leg popping back into place.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>“Well shoot, she really is moving again.” The guard with Twilight observed. <text:s/>All of the ponies had turned their attention to Wild including all of the guards. <text:s/>The watched as loose foreleg was pulled back into place, and her head reattached. <text:s/>She then decided to get to work collecting her various bits and stood up even though she was still missing an abdomen. <text:s/>She was stretching her legs when he caught sight of one pony trying to sneak away while the others stood there gaping. <text:s/>Narrowing her eyes, she yelled, “Hey you, where are you going?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:span text:style-name="T55"><text:tab/>Upon being called out the pony began running. <text:s/>Wild sprinted after him the crowd either ducking or diving out of her path. <text:s/>When she got to the edge of the crowd she jump over them and landed near the runner. <text:s/>She formed a needle at the edge of her hoof and loaded it with manticore venom. <text:s/>With a quickly jab to the flank the running pony was paralyzed and fell in a heap to the ground sliding a short distance. <text:s/>Calmly Wild tossed him on her back and returned to the fountain. <text:s/>The ponies wisely making way for her since they did not want to get in the way of what amounted to a large skeleton with some loose flesh carrying another pony. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T135">She set him down on a clean spot near the fountain and turned to survey the mess. <text:s/>W</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T55">ild elongated her tail and used it to sweep up the mess </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T135">scattered around the square</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T55">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>Twilight was the first to recover. <text:s/>When Wild saw Twilight approach she sat down and let strands of her tail extend independently to finish cleaning. <text:s/>She did not remember to close her chest until Twilight made some vague gestures and developed a green tint.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>“Hey, Wild are you OK?” Twilight ventured coming to a stop right in front of Wild.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:span text:style-name="T55"><text:tab/>Wild sighed, “I don&apos;t think I have been for years.” <text:s/>looking </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T135">around she lamented, “I thought I left all this behind. <text:s/>I can break down latter, this situation needs to be handled now.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49"><text:tab/>“Alright, but you really should talk to someone.” <text:s/>Twilight relented.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:span text:style-name="T135"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T136">Seeing she had gotten all of her missing parts Wild retracted her tail back to a normal length. <text:s/>One of the guards, this one in a </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T137">suit rather than armor, got her attention as he drawled, “I am </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T140">Colonel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T137"> Cobalt Might of the Ponyville guard I assume you have a good reason for attacking and subduing a pony.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"><text:tab/>“While literally everyone else was staring at me he was trying to sneak away. <text:s/>Struck me as pretty suspicious.” Wild answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"><text:tab/>“Can you revive him?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:span text:style-name="T137"><text:tab/>“Yes, you want him now.” Wild offered and once the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T140">Colonel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T137"> agreed, went to remove the paralysis. <text:s/>Doing the same as she did to paralyze him but using the antidote instead the stallion was moving in just a few seconds. <text:s/>He did not try to escape knowing it would be foolish, but he did decide to start talking.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:span text:style-name="T137"><text:tab/>“We will strike you down, monster.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T138">he declared, “It&apos;s only a matter of time now, we will not stop.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“What, I&apos;m a monster just because I&apos;m not a normal pony?” retorted Wild, “I think the one who dropped a bomb in the middle of town is more of a monster!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“Sacrifices must be made. <text:s/>We shall not suffer a monster to live.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:span text:style-name="T138"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T139">Enough you two.” Cobalt ordered, “Someone put this stallion in a cell.” <text:s/>He paused to make sure that the order was followed before continuing, “And you Miss Way what exactly are you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/>“A shape shifter,” <text:s/>she replied watching the stallion being led away, “the only name I&apos;ve ever heard being &apos;prototype&apos;.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/>“And Miss Sparkle since you don&apos;t seem surprised, can I assume you know her and that she is a shape shifter?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:span text:style-name="T139"><text:tab/>“Yes </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T140">Colonel</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T139">.” Twilight answered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:span text:style-name="T139"><text:tab/>“Alright, good enough for me, towns had stranger things wander in just don&apos;t cause problems Miss Way. <text:s/>Now, I want to know why you blew up.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T140">Wild recounted the recent events in the square to the Colonel. <text:s/>Afterwards the Colonel asked, “Where are the fragments of the device, we didn&apos;t recover any of them?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>Wild took said fragments out of her bag and explained, “They all ended up in embedded inside me, that should be all of them.” <text:s/>She offered them to the Colonel, but he had one of his men collect them in an evidence bag.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:span text:style-name="T140"><text:tab/>“Would you be willing to do a quick question and answer session.” <text:s/>The Colonel asked watching the ponies milling around the edge of the square, “I imagine it might put ponies at ease or at least prevent them from using their imaginations.” <text:s/>Wild agreed and both she and Cobalt stood before the towns ponies. <text:s/>Cobalt announced, “Towns ponies as I&apos;m sure you noticed there has been an attack here only an hour ago. <text:s/>The assailant dropped an explosive device next to Miss Wild Way. <text:s/>Due to her unorthodox actions she was the only one seriously injured by the device. <text:s/>We are investigating the matter, but the likely assailant has already been arrested. <text:s/>Many of you are probably wondering how Wild Way is now fine despite having the majority of her body obliterated less than an hour ago. <text:s/>That is why I have asked her to give a small introduction and accept questions from you.” <text:s/>Cobalt stood back and allowed Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T141">introduce herself.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:span text:style-name="T141"><text:tab/>“Hello, I am Wild Way and as many of you likely saw, I am not exactly a normal pony. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T142">I am actually a shape shifter which also allows me to keep my body alive even after otherwise lethal amounts of damage. <text:s/>So, what do you want to know?” <text:s/>Wild explained to the ponies. <text:s/>Once she finished they burst into cacophony of questions.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“Quiet all of you, one question at a time. <text:s/>She can&apos;t answer if y&apos;all are talking over each other.” Cobalt yelled rolling his eyes at the group of supposed adult ponies. <text:s/>The session proceeded in an orderly fashion from there.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T238">Are you an alien</text:span>?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T238">Yes, I was summoned here, but I don&apos;t know why.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T238">So</text:span> you<text:span text:style-name="T238">&apos;re</text:span> an alien invader?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“No, I was summoned here. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T238">Nothing on my original planet could send me here</text:span>.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“What do you eat?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T238">I can eat most anything, preferably desserts</text:span>.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“What&apos;s your favorite flavor?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“Chocolate”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“You&apos;ve been lying bout being a pony, why should we trust you now?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T238">I&apos;m a shape shifter, I don&apos;t have a &apos;true&apos; form so I went with an Earth pony one. <text:s/>If wanting to fit in easier makes me a liar then so be it, but I never insisted I was a pony, nor did I really try hard to keep it secret.</text:span>”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T238">Ya been tricking ponies, I say that&apos;s lying.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T238">I would be surprised if you didn&apos;t have your own secrets, but I guess we will ust have to agree </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T238">to disagree on this point.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>“Ya said you can eat anything, does that include ponies?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T238">I do eat meat, so I guess so. <text:s/>Not that I intend to try, the Everfree forest has worked just fine for food</text:span>.” <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T238">answered Wild dreading the reaction. <text:s/>The ponies began murmuring among themselves some now fearful, while others pointed out that if anything Wild would discourage Everfree predators. <text:s/>The questions quickly tapered off with so many muling over the last answer. <text:s/>By the end of the questions Wild was emotionally exhausted and ready to find a place to collapse into sleep. <text:s/>Twilight was the first to get to her and practically demanded she sleep over. <text:s/>Saying good bye to her other friends she went with Twilight. <text:s/>She was too tired to even worry about Spike&apos;s fire breath and just flopped onto a couch her face buried in the cushion.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P77" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 8</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T238">Wild woke when she felt a nudge to her shoulder, but decided to remain still and hope it would go away. <text:s/>Instead the nudging became full on shaking, and calling her name. <text:s/>To ward off her attacker she told them to go away though it lost its effect as the couch cushion muffled her words. <text:s/>Finally her attacker relented with a huff and she could return to sleeping.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T239">Fine, stay asleep, but I&apos;m still bringing you downstairs regardless.” her attacker declared. <text:s/>Before Wild fully considered the words she felt a pull on her tail and ended up face down on the floor. <text:s/>She merely groaned as she was dragged along.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T239">Three ponies and a dragon watched as Flitter slowly pulled a lump of pony into the room by the tail. <text:s/>Dropping her burden in the middle of the room Flitter also flopped onto the floor.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T239">You weigh a ton Wild,” Flitter puffed out, “What have you been eating?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T239">A manticore.” Wild mumbled as she reluctantly looked around the room, “I guess my plan to ignore the world until goes away is vetoed.” <text:s/>Seated around the room were Twilight, Spike, Lyra, and Lucent with Flitter catching her breath. <text:s/>Wild addressed the group around her, “So why is such an eclectic group waiting for me?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T239">We&apos;re worried about you,” Twilight pleaded, “After yesterday&apos;s... events you seemed pretty upset, and it is the second time that someone tried to kill you. <text:s/>We want to help, but you need to talk to us.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T239">Wild went to tell them that she was fine, but stopped. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T40">I said that wasn&apos;t true yesterday, and it&apos;s still not true today, <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T143">Wild realized looking down at her hooves, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T40">Well nothing ventured nothing gained.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T143"> “It&apos;s not that they tried to kill me, I&apos;ve lived with the threat of death for so long I&apos;m to jaded for it to be a problem. <text:s/>It&apos;s the method, and their attitude to it. <text:s/>He used a bomb in the middle of a populated area, on some level he considered all of the ponies there acceptable losses.” <text:s/>Wild paused to collect her thoughts <text:s/>and remarked, “You know even if I was the monster, I still found ponies trying to be heroes and stop me to be comforting.” <text:s/>Wild&apos;s mood to a sudden drop when she seethed, “I hate the idea of acceptable losses. <text:s/>My home was an acceptable loss, my parents were an acceptable loss, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T144">all of my friends were </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T144">acceptable losses, I was an accepta--” A sudden crack interrupt her and she felt something impact the inside of her cheek. <text:s/>Using a hoof she pulled a partial tooth from her mouth and stared at it. <text:s/>She had </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T180">managed to</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T144"> grit her teeth hard enough to crack them. <text:s/>Deciding that was a good cue to calm down she finished with, “And that&apos;s why I was upset yesterday.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:tab/>The rest of the ponies in the room took a while longer to process the information they had just received. <text:s/>Wild soon found herself part of a pony pile the only ones not included being Spike and Lucent. <text:s/>Once the girls separated Twilight declared, “You don&apos;t need to worry, Equestria&apos;s a pretty safe place, and the ponies that keep attacking you will be stopped.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P87"><text:tab/>“Thanks girls, it is nice to having someone to talk to.” Wild confessed some moisture still in her eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T144"><text:tab/>“Unfortunately, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T145">we still need to talk about the attack as well as your paperwork Miss Way.” Lucent announced once everyone had recomposed themselves.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T145"><text:tab/>“Well the attack was straight forward. <text:s/>A pony dropped a fragmentation grenade in my lap, I ate it to suppress the damage, and the results were pretty dramatic. <text:s text:c="2"/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T146">That pony also decided to stay in the crowd, I guess to see if the explosive worked, but I caught him when he tried to sneak away.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P88"><text:tab/>“What about Martial Bravery what do you know of him?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T146"><text:tab/>“He started stalking me the first day I arrived and referred to me as an &apos;undead abomination&apos;. <text:s/>I assume he&apos;s with the bomber pony and that they were set off by my lack of a cutie mark.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T147">Wild mused, “I guess they weren&apos;t too far off, technically I have died and come back.” <text:s/>That got a few quirked eyebrows.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P89"><text:tab/>“What do you mean by that?”<text:tab/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T147"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T148">I was infected and as with every one else infected by this virus, my entire body was consumed and remade for the virus&apos; purposes. <text:s/>The only odd part was that my mind somehow made it through to the other end </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T149">intact.” <text:s/>Wild shrugge</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T150">d before laughing at the other ponies leaning away. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T151">Unlike the ponies Spike was leaning forward paying rapt attention. <text:s/>Wild assured, “Don&apos;t worry you&apos;re not at risk of becoming zombies.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P90"><text:tab/>Flitter interjected, “Just what the Tartarus happened to you home?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T151"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T154">Alright, I guess I can tell you about my home</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T151">,” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T152">Wild said as all attention was on her,</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T151"> “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T152">Well, the </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T151">moderately terrible part </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T152">at least</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T151">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T152">Fortunately for me the first 17 or so years of my life were normal. <text:s/>I went to school, had sleep overs, friends, all that normal teenage girl stuff. <text:s/>Then a virus was released and my world basically ended. <text:s/>Within a day the part of the city I lived in became a disaster zone, thousands already dead, and more joining them at a frightening rate. <text:s/>The only silver line being that part of the city was on an island and was quarantined quickly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T152"><text:tab/>Wild took a breath before continuing, “I learned all of this later, but the virus that was released was not natural it was created by a black ops group called Blackwatch. <text:s/>They would handle things the government wanted done, but didn&apos;t want to be connected to like assassination, or terrorist operations in </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T152">foreign countries. <text:s/>The started with the goal of taking the worst missions to protect everyone else from having to even know about them. <text:s/>By the time of the disaster they had shifted to a goal of protecting the nation at any cost, even having to sacrifice part of a city and the millions living there. <text:s/>They didn&apos;t even try to save anyone since we knew too much and could harm Blackwatch if we survived.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:tab/>At this point Wild eyes were focused on some distant point and her voice had lost all emotion as her words spilled out, “Blackwatch also doubled as a weapons research facility. <text:s/>Terrible weapons designed to kill as <text:span text:style-name="T260">efficiently</text:span> as possible which is where the virus came from. <text:s/>It was intended to be a weapon of mass destruction to destroy &apos;problematic&apos; cities quickly and quietly. <text:s/>It was supposed ot spread throughout the population rapidly and have a 100 percent fatality rate. <text:s/>They got close, it killed everything in its path, but it had the nasty habit of reviving them as monstrous carriers of the disease. <text:s/>Basically a zombie apocalypse that was neither discrete nor controllable.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:tab/>Wild had refocused on Lucent, but her tone remained lifeless, “I assume you will report this part to the Princess, its probably best she know. <text:s/>To be clear, I am essentially a walking plague. <text:s/>I could infect everything around me and cause a pandemic. <text:s/>I find the very thought of letting this virus run wild abhorrent so as long as I am alive that&apos;s not going to happen. <text:s/>I&apos;ve already lost everyone and everything I loved once, I&apos;m not about to let that happen again. <text:s/>Also, I was captured by Blackwatch and developed <text:s/>some neurosis from that. <text:s/>One of them being a fear of being captured again, so if that was being considered please don&apos;t. <text:s/>It will end poorly, its just a question of how poorly.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P91"><text:tab/>“I hope thats not a threat.” Lucent accused with narrowed eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T152"><text:tab/>Wild was just glad to be on another topic and answered, “No, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T153">I basically have a whole collection of phobias including a fear of being trapped. <text:s/>I&apos;m not sure what that one is called.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P92"><text:tab/>“Cleithrophobia.” Twilight supplied automatically.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P92"><text:tab/>“I have cleithrophobia,” Wild repeated, ”so if I get trapped I am compelled to find a way out. <text:s/>If I can&apos;t get out then I will try harder until something breaks, possibly myself even. <text:s/>Its not a matter of trying to be difficult I would literally go crazy otherwise.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P92"><text:tab/>Lucent sighed, “You are going to be a constant source of headaches aren&apos;t you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P92"><text:tab/>Wild chuckled, “You aren&apos;t the first to say that, but yes I will.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T153"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T154">I don&apos;t suppose you would be willing to not use this virus?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93"><text:tab/>“No, that not really possible. <text:s/>Like I told Twilight I am technically a viral gestalt. <text:s/>The virus produces some sort of telepathic hive mind and for the strain contained within me my mind has had the dubious honor of becoming the hive mind. <text:s/>I cannot avoid using the virus anymore than a pony can avoid using their brain.” Wild explained before adding, “Though some seem to be giving it a good attempt.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93"><text:tab/>“Wait your telepathic?” Flitter asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93"><text:tab/>“I can only read my own mind,” Wild answered, “though it does mean that I can control my body even if its in multiple parts. <text:s/>That&apos;s pretty disorienting, so I try to avoid that.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P93"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“Do you have any other abilities aside from shape shifting and a hive mind?” Lucent asked writing something in a notebook he pulled from his armor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T154"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T155">I can infect things too, but that just listing them is pretty misleading.” <text:s/>Wild elaborated, “When I infect something it becomes part of me since the hive mind will expand to include it. <text:s/>The part you will most likely be interested in is that I assimilate everything biological from what I infect. <text:s/>That includes the genetics, physical characteristics like scars, and memories.” <text:s/>Wild paused as she watched the implication sink in. <text:s/>Lucent, Twilight, and Lyra all had their ears pulled back, and the color drained from their faces. <text:s/>Spike and Flitter were mostly unaffected since they were only considering personal implications. <text:s/>Wild continued, “I can see you realize just how serious of a threat that could be which is why I also want to tell you Blackwatch&apos;s solution. <text:s/>They made viral detectors and while its not a perfect solution it is effective. <text:s/>I can&apos;t really go anywhere without virus after all. <text:s/>The last thing is that my shape shifting is actually perfect control of every cell in my body on a genetic level meaning I can reproduce traits from any DNA I consume. <text:s/>I can also mix and match stuff as much as I want.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P94"><text:tab/>“You are being oddly forthcoming.” <text:s/>Lucent commented while continuing to write everything down, “Distressingly so. <text:s/>I would think you might keep those kinds of abilities secret.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P94"><text:tab/>Wild blushed at that and mumbled, “I&apos;m not very good at keeping secrets. <text:s/>Pathologically incapable of it really.” <text:s/>Her voice regained a normal volume as she continued, “I figure its better to just get it out of the way quickly and to be the one to do it. <text:s/>I also hope providing the beginnings of a solution will help smooth things over.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P94"><text:tab/>“Wait, you said pathologically,” Twilight questioned, “how can you be pathologically incapable of keeping a secret?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T155"><text:tab/>The effect of that question was subtle, but left the ponies unnerved with the impression that death had just passed them by. <text:s/>Wild had stammered, “Answer the question and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T157">it doesn&apos;t get worse</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T155">.” as her coat and eyes lost their vibrancy </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T156">before she just stopped. <text:s/>Twilight was the first to do anything when she approached Wild. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T157">She could she Wild&apos;s lips moving but no sounds was produced. <text:s/>Then Twilight noticed why there was a lack of noise. <text:s/>There was no air to speak with since Wild had stopped breathing. <text:s/>Twilight also checked for a pulse and found none. <text:s/>Unfortunately she did not know what to do and started her own panic attack by pacing and mumbling incoherently.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:tab/>Lyra ended up being the one to step up and bring the situation back under control. <text:s/>Drawing in a breath she asked, “Hey Wild, what would you like for breakfast?” <text:s/>She received four completely different reaction in quick succession.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:tab/>“Bacon!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:tab/>“What?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:tab/>“That worked!?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:tab/>Twilight just bleated and fell over.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P95"><text:tab/>“Not quite.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T157"><text:tab/>Wild look around in confusion before her memory set to work. <text:s/>Her ears folded back as she said, “Ah, I&apos;m sorry. <text:s/>That topic is still a little raw and I would like to avoid it for now. <text:s/>The surface of it is that I was captured and &apos;interrogated&apos; by Blackwatch. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T158">Suffice it to say t</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T157">hat has left a lasting impression and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T158">I can&apos;t leave question unanswered</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T157">.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T157"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T158">Before anyone else could Lucent interjected, “I think I slight change of subject is in order.” <text:s/>Digging around in his armor he pulled a small packet of papers </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T159">out and passed them over to Wild and explained, “Here is a naturalization form for you. <text:s/>Please fill it out as best you can and then once filed you will officially be an Equestrian citizen.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:tab/>Glad for the distraction Wild began filling the papers out. <text:s/>The rest of the ponies also relaxed from the recent storm of emotion letting all the new information settle. <text:s/>The papers were just a standard request for naturalization and Wild quickly filled out the parts she could, but ran into a few problems.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:tab/>“Um, what should I put for species... and gender for that matter.” Wild asked, “I can change both of those at will.”<text:tab/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:tab/>“Just put which ever gender you want, but for the species something unique.” <text:s/>Lucent answered.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:tab/>“Alright, female Blacklight pony then.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:tab/>“A Blacklight pony?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:tab/>“Blacklight was the viruses codename and I intend to stay more or less a pony.” Wild shrugged before moving onto the next unanswered question. <text:s/>Wild said, “Um, I don&apos;t really have a place of residence.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:tab/>“Where have you been living?” Lyra asked.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:tab/>“Just around town, I don&apos;t need to sleep and there&apos;s plenty of food wandering around in the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Also, I&apos;m more durable than the average house, so I don&apos;t have a pressing ned for a house.” Wild explained.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:tab/>“I&apos;ll make a note to check what the princess wants to do, for now just leave it blank.” Lucent said.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P96"><text:tab/>Wild worried about her next question as she asked, “So, how much of a problem is it that I may have murdered around a dozen people?” <text:s/>That got a reaction as everyone scooted away from her except Twilight who was still insensate.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:span text:style-name="T159"><text:tab/>“Alright, another note for the princess then.” Lucent </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T160">sighed and took the papers once Wild had finished writing. <text:s/>Adding his own notes plus a couple new ones Lucent neatly gathered the papers into a single pile. <text:s/>He then turned to Spike and requested, “Spike would you send these to Princess Celestia, please?” <text:s/>Shortly the papers were whisked off as a puff of smoke and the two males noticed a missing pony. <text:s/>Flitter and Lyra were starring mouths agape at one of the walls, but Wild was no where to be found. <text:s/>Twilight had rolled over and begun snoring so everyone knew where she was. <text:s/>Lucent inquired, “Where did Wild Way go?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T160"><text:tab/>Lyra pointed at the wall, but Lucent only saw a wooden support column resembling a log. <text:s/>Thinking a bit he realized why that was odd, the library was built inside a tree. <text:s/>It did not have any columns with bark on the outside. <text:s/>Walking over he knocked on the log not really expecting anything in particular. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T161">Instead a pair of eyes opened in front of him and the log whispered, “Is the fire gone?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P97"><text:tab/>“Yes, there is no more fire.” Lucent replied, “Unless you have something else you need I think I am going to check in with the local garrison.” <text:s/>Lucent began walking away and was soon out of the building.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P97"><text:tab/>“I think he&apos;s a little high strung.” Lyra commented.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P97"><text:tab/>Flitter looked around at the ponies that were still present. <text:s/>Spike had wandered off after sending the papers, and Twilight was only technically present in the physical sense. <text:s/>Flitter realized something and worried, “Am I one of the crazy ponies now?” Lyra&apos;s laughing was not the response she was hoping for.</text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P81" text:outline-level="2">Chapter 9</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T240">The rest of the day was spent lounging around town after the recent events for Wild. <text:s/>During the night she decided to go on another walk through the forest to see what she could find. <text:s/>She would welcome another manticore, but her real target was much smaller. <text:s/>She was looking for a spider to explore the possibilities of spider silk. She did manage to find a few species of spiders after hours of looking, but not much else since she stayed near to the edge of the forest.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T240">Now that she had a good collection of spider genes it was time to experiment. <text:s/>In this case that amounted to creating a huge mess with globs and filaments of spider webbing covering herself and much of the surrounding flora. <text:s/>Her persistence payed off as she figured out how to consistently make silk fibers without sticking parts of the forest to her body. <text:s/>Working from there she tried adding more spinnerets rather than making them larger and succeeded in making strands large enough to support her weight. <text:s/>She considered the possible marketing opportunities, but first she had much more important business.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T240">While she was experimenting an observer had shown up hiding in a tree. <text:s/>The darkness and leaf cover did next to nothing in blocking Wild&apos;s sonar. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T41">This is getting ridiculous, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T162">she fumed, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T41">can&apos;t a girl get some privacy. <text:s/>At least I&apos;m not subjected to most biologically needs or I would really be pissed. Heh. </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T162">One more practice session and her plans were complete. <text:s/>She could now launch her ropes, meaning there was only one reasonable course of action.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:span text:style-name="T162"><text:tab/>“Spidermare. <text:s/>Spidermare, doing whatever a Spidermare can.” <text:s/>She sang </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T163">as she swung from branch to branch sing her spider silk as a grapple. <text:s/>Her spectator did not follow either because of her speed, shear surprise at her actions, or scare at the fact she had run into several trees. <text:s/>The trees were obliterated before being consumed in an unintentional display of raw power. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T164">Approaching the tree line she built up as much speed as she could and swung up into the air. <text:s/>Reaching a height well above the canopy when she launched out of the forest she went into a series somersaults. <text:s/>She stuck the landing with a shower dirt and loud ground shaking thud. <text:s/>Of course, had she been anyone else landing on her </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T164">head with that much force would have been a lot worse. <text:s/>Wild walked away with just a headache and the knowledge that her enthusiasm outpaced her skills in gymnastics.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:span text:style-name="T164"><text:tab/>Walking through town was a little tense. <text:s/>None of the ponies did anything overt, but a few would watch Wild longer than necessary, particularly when foals were around. <text:s/>There was also a conspicuous bubble around her that ponies would either avoid or hurry out of. <text:s/>Annoyed, she decided that the best solution would be exposure therapy and parked herself in the middle of the town square. <text:s/>The towns ponies would either get used to her, or just have to avoid the middle of town forever. <text:s/>That plan lasted until Lyra showed up to bring Wild to her first club meeting.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P98"><text:span text:style-name="T164"><text:tab/>The club meeting was held in town hall and a couple dozen ponies already present when the pair walked in. <text:s/>Lyra got a few greetings, but Wild ended up with the most attention. <text:s/>In contrast to the general population, the ponies here were eager to meet her and swarmed around in a cacophony of greetings. <text:s/>Lyra had made her way to the front of the room to stand on a stage. <text:s/>Once enough time had passed she called for attention and all of the ponies found their way to a palce in front of the stage.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T164"><text:tab/>“Welcome </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T165">fellow Conspiracy Hunters</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T164">, let&apos;s get this meeting started. <text:s/>We have some </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T165">urgent new developments which is why I called this emergency meeting. <text:s/>First though we have a new member with us today. <text:s/>She&apos;s even the source of the developments. <text:s/>Everyone welcome Wild Way, our brand new resident alien shape shifter.” Lyra pontificated clearly enjoying being a ham. <text:s/>Wild stood up at that and waved to the crowd. <text:s/>There was a decent amount of clapping and greetings, but the one that Wild noticed the most were the smiles on the ponies faces. <text:s/>They were clearly excited for this new development, and not even remotely worried about her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T165"><text:tab/>Wild was having a surprisingly hard time grasping the concept that these ponies knew what she was, but were not freaking out. <text:s/>She even ventured, “None of you look worried about me.” She faltered, “I...”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T165"><text:tab/>Seeing the beginning of tears the nearest mare to Wild drew her into a hug, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T166">rather impressive since Wild weighed at least twice as much as the mare. <text:s/>“Come here dear, you&apos;re among friends.” the mare cooed. <text:s text:c="2"/>Every time Wild tried to protest the mare just silenced her until Wild gave in a relaxed into the hug. <text:s/>“It doesn&apos;t matter what you are here, everyone here is capable of terrible things. <text:s/>We are all well aware that just because you can do something doesn&apos;t mean you will.” <text:s/>Wild just cried on the mare&apos;s shoulder as she realized that maybe her tribulations would end.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T166"><text:tab/>Breaking the hug, and wiping her face Wild croaked, “I guess after spending years in a war zone, sometimes I forget that there can be nice people.” <text:s/>That concept surprised the entire room, war happens occasionally, but there had not been a war lasting years in centuries.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T166"><text:tab/>One curious stallion asked, “What were they fighting over for so long?” <text:s/>He received a few glares for that and shrunk back.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T166"><text:tab/>Wild </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T182">gave a humourless</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T166"> chuckled, “The world I come from is much more violent from what I&apos;ve seen, the conflict only spanned a fifth of the city it was in. <text:s/>As for the reasons, it was two groups of monsters fighting. <text:s/>One wanted to remake everyone in their own image. <text:s/>The process they used was </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T166">much less pleasant than that sounds. <text:s/>The other group wanted to cover up the whole thing, and also had a penchant for doing experiments on civilians stuck in the area. <text:s/>They really didn&apos;t want it known that they had created the first group and lost control of it.” <text:s/>Conversation died down after that allowing Lyra to retake control of the meeting.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T166"><text:tab/>“The next order of business, unfortunately is the confirmation of our worst suspicions. <text:s/>The Keepers are targeting Wild Way to point that they risked the lives of towns ponies that happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. <text:s/>Thank Wild for your quick thinking, that attack could have been much worse.” <text:s/>Lyra lamented taking a moment before continuing, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T167">As well there has been a cases of spying, stabbing, and possibly weaponized lightning. <text:s/>The only reason this hasn&apos;t been a case of murder, is because Wild Way is nigh immortal.” <text:s/>Wild shrugged and confirmed it, not much short of complete cellular death would actually kill her. <text:s/>Lyra asserted, “This is not acceptable, we need to do something. <text:s/>I think it is time to start working a plan to reveal ourselves. <text:s/>I have the least risk though, so what do all of you think?” <text:s/>Murmurs spread throughout the crowd, until the mare sitting next to Wild offered her support. <text:s/>Even though her support was tentative it still got gasp from many of the ponies.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T167"><text:tab/>“It is quite an exciting time, but the actions against Wild Way prove at least one thing beyond a doubt. <text:s/>The Itinerant Keepers are not something we can play around with, and there will be no second chances with them in any sens of the phrase.” <text:s/>the mare proclaimed. <text:s/>Now that she was not crying Wild got a good look at the mare. <text:s/>She had a coat a shade lighter green than Wild&apos;s, but her mane was much more distinctive. <text:s/>It was braided all the way down her neck, thin streaks of white hair running through the vibrant red that made up the bulk. <text:s/>The distinct lines on her face were the only hint of age, otherwise she appeared as a mare in her prime. <text:s/>Her flank was adorned by a single rose bud. <text:s/>The mare continued speaking, “We cannot afford to be discovered by them, but we cannot simply stay the course and hope that we don&apos;t get revealed. <text:s/>Instead, we need to reveal our selves on our own terms.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T167"><text:tab/>The crowd started debating the issue but it was clear they would not reach an agreement. <text:s/>This was more to brainstorm ideas than to come up with a ready to go plan anyway. <text:s/>Wild waited for them to agree to disagree before she asked, “Hey, I know what species Lyra is, but what about everyone else?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T167"><text:tab/>“We forgot to do the introductions.” Lyra groaned, “You have already met our resident blood sucker, Doctor Humor the vampire.” <text:s/>He stood and bowed. “The wolfpony twins Shepherd and Collie </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T168">run a pet shop in town.” <text:s/>a mare and stallion waved. <text:s/>“And everyone else is a love bug with Rose as the Ponyville changeling queen.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T168"><text:tab/>“What&apos;s a changeling?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T168"><text:tab/>Instead of Lyra the mare next to Wild, Rose spoke up, “We are a race of shape shifter that consume love. <text:s/>While being more or less ponies, we do have many insectoid traits. <text:s/>Lyra has decided that we are love bugs because of this.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T168"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T169">How does one consume love?” Wild asked perplexed by the concept.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T169"><text:tab/>“Technically the love is a catalyst for siphoning energy, but saying we eat love is easier.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T242">What does an insectoid pony look like anyway?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T242">Well, I&apos;ll show you mine if you show me yours.” Rose grinned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T242">I... Alright, I can show you a larger version of what I originally looked like.” Wild spluttered at the innuendo. <text:s/>She reared up and let a swarm of black tendrils break down her pony form. <text:s/>Within just a few seconds a 7 foot tall woman appeared with the muscular build of an amazon. <text:s/>She even made a pair of jeans and green shirt that looked brand new. <text:s/>A pack was slung across her shoulder since saddle bags would not work for a human. <text:s/>Her hair stretched half way down her back this time and she absently ran her fingers through it. <text:s/>“Huh, I forgot how nice fingers are.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T243">I did not expect you to be bipedal. <text:s/>You are quite pretty as you are though, but where did the clothes come from?” <text:s/>Rose admired as she and the rest of the ponies came closer to get a good look.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T243">Part of the shape shifting, they are actually made from modified hair essentially.” <text:s/>Wild explained before removing her bag, “Fully detachable too.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T243">That is an impressive ability,” Rose admitted, “My turn then.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T243">Wait, don&apos;t...” Lyra tried to warn just now remembering how changeling transformation worked. <text:s/>Unfortunately she was too late and Rose burst in to green flames. <text:s/>They burned away her current form, and left just as quickly to reveal a large black form. <text:s/>Rose still had the basic equine shape, but was covered in black chitin instead of fur. <text:s/>Circling her torso was a green band, and her back had a pink saddle shaped plate on it. <text:s/>Her mane was also pink and a long horn jutted out from the center of her forehead. <text:s/>The biggest change was her height, she was about twice the height of a pony and reached Wild&apos;s current height with the tip of her horn. <text:s/>On top of her head was a trio of antennae that resembled a crown.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T244">Wild was still caught up in the fiery display. <text:s/>Seeing someone else burst into flames managed to confuse her phobia since she was equally afraid of losing someone to fire as she was of the fire itself. <text:s/>In the end the fire was completely gone before she could reach a decision on how to act. <text:s/>Her first action after seeing a blackened figure that was just aflame was to immediately grab Rose and inspect the damage going so far as to lift her from the ground. <text:s/>“You&apos;re not burnt?” she hesitated now seeing that Rose was covered in chitin and not charred, “but you were just on fire.” <text:s/>Wild was frozen trying to figure out this puzzle.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T244">I forgot that she was deathly afraid of fire.” Lyra confessed to Rose.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T244">Well, this is a strange predicament but I&apos;ve been in worse.” Rose replied from her position in Wild&apos;s hands, “She certainly is a strong one though. <text:s/>Not many could just casually pick up a changeling queen.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T244">Wild brain had finished processing and reached the conclusion that she had an unharmed and adorable new creature. <text:s/>She drew the changeling into a hug and cooed, “You&apos;re adorable.” <text:s/>Everyone one in the room stopped as they tried to understand the alien in their midst, particularly the disguised changelings that had moved to rescue their queen.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T244">I think that is the first time anyone has described us as adorable,” Rose perplexed, “but could </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T244">you let me down, this is a bit of an awkward position.” <text:s/>Wild did so and blushed after reviewing her recent actions.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T244">&apos;m Sorry, I got caught up in the moment” Wild apologized, “but how are you not burned at all.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T244">Changelings are immune to fire, and other chemical reactions for that matter. <text:s/>Their magic prevents them from being forcefully transformed, which includes such reactions.” Lyra lectured.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T244">You&apos;re immune to fire, too.” <text:s/>Wild beamed eyes sparkling in her admiration, “Changelings are awesome.” <text:s/>As if worried that speaking to loud would break something Wild whispered, “What about detached pieces of chitin, are those fireproof?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T245">Head tilted to the side Rose answered, “I don&apos;t actually know, it&apos;s never been tested before.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T245">Undeterred Wild continued, “Can we try, I can make a piece? <text:s/>I just need a DNA sample.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T245">You are strangely obsessed with this,” Rose relented, “but now I&apos;m curious too. <text:s/>What does it take for a DNA sample?” <text:s/>Wild explained the process and gave Rose one of the water canteens from her bag. <text:s/>Rose rinsed with it, and spit the water back in before returning it. <text:s/>A few seconds after replacing the canteen, Wild pulled a small sheet of chitin out to the surprise of her spectators. <text:s/>Rose marveled, “I am slightly surprised that worked. <text:s/>I can&apos;t help but wonder what one of the Canterlot Universities would make of this.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T245">Wild had already hidden in on a second floor balcony just peeking over the edge. <text:s/>Lyra was able to provide the needed fire for the test. <text:s/>It turned out that the chitin was not immune to fire like it would be on a changeling, but it held up until rock melting temperatures. <text:s/>That was good enough for Wild, and changeling chitin became her single favorite material. <text:s/>Wild and Rose returned to their normal forms, though Wild used a changeling variant for fur and hair. <text:s/>The rest of ponies wandered off since the meeting was finished, but both Rose and Wild remained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T245">Wild have you given any thought to getting a house in Ponyville?” <text:s/>Rose inquired as the two mares trotted down the street.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T245">Not really, I couldn&apos;t afford to for so long I just forgot it was something I could do.” <text:s/>Wild explained with a growing smile, “Now that you brought it up it would be nice to have a place to call my own. <text:s/>I would have to build my own...” she gulped, “or it might be burned down.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T246">Well, I don&apos;t know if you are interested, but I actually have an available plot of land just inside the Everfree forest.” <text:s/>Rose offered, “Most ponies would not be even remotely interested in such a location, but I imagine it wouldn&apos;t be a problem for you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T246">It wouldn&apos;t.” Wild confirmed, but quirked an eyebrow as she challenged, “You have an ulterior motive though, why else would you just offer me something like that, or own land in the forest for that matter?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T246">True,” Rose said, “owned was perhaps not the right word. <text:s/>My group has special needs and as such needs a place to handle those. <text:s/>We are also somewhat secretive so the Everfree forest was our choice. <text:s/>Its reputation would keep the nosy away, and there is plenty of space as the entire thing is </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T246">essentially unclaimed. <text:s/>However, the forest is dangerous, and with the recent activity our fighting ability leaves something to be desired. <text:s/>I was-”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T246">You want me to be a meat-shield for you.” Wild interrupted. <text:s text:c="2"/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T42">I should probably feel insulted by this, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T170">Wild wondered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T42">but it does present an opportunity. <text:s/>Not like its different from what I would be doing anyway.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T171"><text:tab/>“Hmm” Wild drew out letting Rose linger in uncertainty. <text:s/>The pair had stopped at the edge of town and Wild even brought a hoof to her chin. <text:s/>She countered, “Alright, but on a few conditions. <text:s/>First, I will defer any legal, or political issues to you should they arise. <text:s/>Second, I want you to provide the building materials for me. <text:s/>And the last one is a bit strange.” <text:s/>Reaching into her bag Wild pulled out what appeared to be an ordinary rock </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T172">the size of a small cat</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T171"> and </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T172">forced</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T171"> her face to remain emotionless </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T172">as she </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T171">said, “I want you to take care of my pet rock.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T171"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T172">Rose just blinked at those requests while Wild patiently waited. <text:s/>Eventually Rose collected wits and asked, “The first two I can understand where you are coming from, but why in the world would you need me to take care of a pet rock?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T172"><text:tab/>Wild grinned, “It&apos;s not actually a rock, though a pet rock is about what it amounts too for the most part. <text:s/>It&apos;s actually a backup plan or me, and is alive. <text:s/>All I need you to do with it is find some safe spot to keep it thats open the outside air. <text:s/>It does eat, but spores and dust from the air will be enough for it.” <text:s/>Seeing that Rose had tilted her head and had not responded Wild went on, “Well, should it be relevant I would need about 100 tons of organic matter for building material. <text:s/>Doesn&apos;t really matter where it comes from.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T172"><text:tab/>“You are one strange mare, but I can agree to those terms. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T173">Let me show you the spot.” Rose agreed and took the &apos;pet rock&apos; from Wild before asking, “When you say organic matter does the state its in matter.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P99"><text:span text:style-name="T173"><text:tab/>“Nope, raw sewage would be fine, but I hope you don&apos;t have that much sewage just laying around.” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T174">The two mares head off to see the location, it was not a far walk as it was the closest section of the forest to the the edge of town. <text:s/>No sense in making it a longer walk than necessary especially when you are trying to be sneaky. <text:s/>The plot itself was a completely generic area of moderate forest on starting on the border and stretching a half mile into the forest. <text:s/>The sole interesting feature was a camouflaged tunnel half way down one of the edges. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T175">Wild was ready to begin her foray into interior design.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P111" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 10</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T247">Wild and Rose stood just outside the hidden tunnel when Wild grinned, “Alright time to see some of what I can do.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T247">What do you mean?” asked Rose but Wild was walking over to a tree nearby tree. <text:s/>When she reached it Wild placed a hoof on its surface, and closed her eyes. <text:s/>She would need a lot of concentration </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T247">for this to prevent any unfortunate accidents. <text:s/>Soon a ring of black tendrils erupted from the tree&apos;s bark around the hoof slowly expanding in a ring. <text:s/>Once it wrapped around the entire trunk the now two rings speed up running up and down the height of the tree. <text:s/>Strangely everywhere the tendrils passed looked exactly as it had before. <text:s/>Another ring would split off for every branch passed and every leaf would appear to erupt in black flame as the tendrils consumed it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T248">Rose was fascinated by the process as the tree was consumed and an exact replica left behind. <text:s/>Seeing the last of the visible tendrils disappear she expected Wild to come out of her trance soon. <text:s/>Rose was confused when that was not the case until new rings of tendrils appeared at the base of the two closest trees. <text:s/>The process repeat itself faster this time and again there was a period of seeming inactivity. <text:s/>Half a dozen trees this time started being consumed in pattern spreading away from the tunnel. <text:s/>Figuring that the pattern would continue she transformed back to her changeling form and watched from the air. <text:s/>Rose just hang in the air above the canopy watching as a black wave spread through the forest.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T249">By the Earth Mother, she is like a forest fire.” Rose whispered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T250">Oh no, she is much more than that.” <text:s/>a mare said next Rose startling the changeling. <text:s/>Casually standing on thin air was a huge Earth pony mare. <text:s/>She was easily a match for Rose in terms of height. <text:s/>Her coat and Mane were both an earthy brown color, but her mane transitioned into vines as it near her body. <text:s/>The vines spread out across her in a thick webbing. <text:s/>Half of them were a vibrant green while the other half were black with wicked looking thorns. <text:s/>Both types covered her entire body running over and under at random and even ran the length of her tail binding it into a thick cord. <text:s/>The mare continued, “She is my latest experiment, and the most dangerous one by far. <text:s/>We are heading into some exciting times.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T250">You&apos;re the one who brought her?” Rose muttered, “Taking her from her world seems rather cruel.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T250">The mare chuckled, “I thought you knew me better than that, Formica. <text:s/>You know that I can be a cruel mistress.” <text:s/>The turned her attention back to Wild&apos;s work prompting Rose to do the same before adding, “Although in this case leaving her alone would have been more cruel. <text:s/>You already realize how terrifying what she&apos;s doing is, but this is controlled. <text:s/>Just imagine what would happen if instead of trees she did this to your changelings starting in the middle of your hive. <text:s/>It looks like nothing has happened down there because she is taking care to minimize the impact. <text:s/>If she wasn&apos;t doing that each of those trees would end up riddled with tumors and raw flesh spilling across the ground.” <text:s/>Looking Rose in the eyes the mystery mare concluded, “That is would be just the beginning of what she experienced.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T251">I go by Rose now, but just have you brought to Equestria, Earth Mother?” Rose demanded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T251">A catalyst.” the Earth Mother replied then turned back to the forest and commented, “Fascinating, leave it to a human to find a way to clear cut part of a forest without disturbing the local ecosystem.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T252">What are you talking about, the forest looks fine.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T252">It only looks fine, for that matter it only looks like a forest too. <text:s/>There isn&apos;t a single tree left down there.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T252">When Rose turned to ask the Earth Mother about her words Rose found only empty space. <text:s/>She huffed and watched Wild work. <text:s/>The line on affected trees ended up tracing out a rough circle about two thirds of a mile squared. <text:s/>A band about half the width of the circle was also affect leading off to the edge of the forest. <text:s/>All told Wild had claimed an enormous section of land for her estate. <text:s/>The sun was getting ready to set by the time she was done.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T253">That was a lot more exhausting than I thought.” <text:s/>Wild breathed eyes drooping and posture slumped. <text:s/>While she was practically immune to physical exhaustion, the stress of managing the spread of her infection taxed her mental endurance more than anything before. <text:s/>However, she was successful every tree in her plot of land was converted without affecting any of the other flora or fauna.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T253">Oh hey, Rose your a lady bug again.” Wild giggled, “Can I crash on your couch?” <text:s/>She managed to make it a few steps toward Rose, but then tripped over her own hooves plopping on her side. <text:s/>Squinting Wild tried to figure out what happen and why she was laying down. <text:s/>Her conclusion was to try again after sleeping. <text:s/>Rose levitated the heap of earth pony onto her back as she set off for her hive. <text:s/>She was in agreement with Wild that some rest might help her make sense of all the recent chicanery.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T254">Rose felt something like a giant mass of squirming worms on her back for a second. <text:s/>When she checked to see what it was she found a tinier version of herself. <text:s/>Rose continued on and speculated, “Oh dear, we are in for a wild ride it seems.” <text:s/>Reaching one of the spare rooms Rose gently set Wild in a bed and left for her own bedroom. <text:s/>She did ask one of her nearby drones to notify her when Wild woke up. <text:s/>She did not pay attention when said drone referred to Wild as her daughter.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T254">When Wild woke up she felt better than she had in a long time, although she did not remember falling asleep in a bed. <text:s/>Looking around the room saw that it was rather spartan with only a bed, table, and lights. <text:s/>The walls and furniture were all made of some kind of hardened dirt cement type compound. <text:s/>The lights were some sort of bioluminescent bulbs on the wall. <text:s/>Figuring it was safe enough she took stock of herself.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T255">Concentrating on her sense Wild realized her awareness was massively expanded. <text:s/>She could vaguely sense the entire forest that she converted, and felt the suns rays on her leaves. <text:s/>They felt deliciously warm almost like eating pancakes hot off the stove. <text:s/>“Oh sweet, I&apos;m solar powered now!” she exclaimed before digging deeper. <text:s/>The wind was the next sensation she found, but it was the strange tapping feeling appearing in a multitude of locations. <text:s/>She could not figure out what it was and decided to pick one and see what it was. <text:s/>Closing her eyes, and growing a new set near the tapping she found a squirrel hopping along a branch. <text:s/>“Oh crap, I&apos;m going to be constantly feeling everything that moves.” <text:s/>she whimpered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T256">Rose walked into the room to find Wild with eyes unfocused, and frowning. <text:s/>“What has you so down, dear?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T256">I have made a horrible miscalculation.” <text:s/>Wild moaned after refocusing her eyes, “I can feel all of the animals, its like being poked incessantly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T257">So you really did decide to assimilate a square mile of forest.” Rose said massaging her brow with a hoof before scolding, “Child, you should have thought of that before you made yourself into a makeshift genius loci. <text:s/>You&apos;re just going to have to learn to deal with it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T257">I realize that now.” Wild whined planting her face on the floor, “on the bright side I have a decent map of the underground, and sunlight is delicious.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T257">What are you talking about now?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T257">I wanted to survey the land as well as claim it, so I made a vast web of roots from the trees. <text:s/>Also, consuming that many trees means I am, um...” Wild explained, “a photo-vore. <text:s/>That&apos;s probably not the right word.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P100"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T257">Huh, at least you got something out of that spectacle yesterday, but you have another situation to deal with. <text:s/>It seems your friends have noticed, and are coming to investigate,” Rose drawled before heading out of the room, “Come on, let&apos;s go.” <text:s/>Wild tried to protest, but Rose just grabbed Wild by the tail with magic and dragged her along. <text:s/>The tunnels they passed through were made of the same material as the bedroom complete with the glowing bulbs. <text:s/>It had a very organic feels as there were no right angles, just curves making the changeling hive labyrinthine. <text:s/>Along the way they encountered a group of changelings who addressed Wild as princess. <text:s/>Both Rose and Wild froze at that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:span text:style-name="T257"><text:tab/>Wild just noticed that she was a changeling and giggled awkwardly. <text:s/>“oops,” she squeaked, and changed back to her normal form. <text:s/>The other changelings decide it was a good time to find anywhere else to be as the tension escalated in the tunnel.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T258">One problem at a time.” Rose reasoned and continued out of the hive. <text:s/>She also changed into her usual disguise before leaving. <text:s/>She was able to keep a hold on Wild when she panicked at the fiery display but not without sliding backward a couple feet even though she had braced herself. <text:s/>The walk through the forest itself was quiet since most of the nearby animals were still confused by Wild&apos;s take over. <text:s/>Wild now traveling under her own power decided to hum in an effort to ignore the infernal tapping.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T259">Rose and Wild exited the forest together not far from a trio of ponies. <text:s/>Rose had a frown on her face and Wild had her ears folded back and was now humming “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T176">taps”</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T43">. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T176">Rose, Twilight, and Fluttershy were all giving her blank looks. <text:s/>The last pony was a blond maned orange earth pony mare with a brown stetson. <text:s/>The hatted pony was glaring at Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:span text:style-name="T176"><text:tab/>“Really. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T177">You&apos;re just here for an explanation not an execution.</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T176">” Rose </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T177">scolded and addressed other group, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T178">Fluttershy, Applejack, and Twilight I assume you</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T177"> are here because of last nights occurrences.” <text:s/>Receiving nods she pushed Wild up to them and said, “Well here&apos;s your explanation. <text:s/>Go on Wild dear.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:span text:style-name="T177"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T178">Well... you see...” Wild stalled and gradually lowered her volume until inaudible.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T178"><text:tab/>“Well, spit it out already, what did you do in the Everfree last night?!” Applejack snarled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:span text:style-name="T178"><text:tab/>“I consumed all of the trees in approximately one square mile of the forest.” Wild said staring at a spot on the ground </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T182">pointedly avoiding Applejack&apos;s eyes</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T178">.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:span text:style-name="T178"><text:tab/>“YOU DID WHAT?!” Applejack yelled stomping up to Wild and tried to get into her face.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:span text:style-name="T178"><text:tab/>“I consumed all of the trees in approximately one square mile of the forest.” Wild repeated still staring at the same spot. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T179">The other tree ponies did not like where this conversation was going, but could only watch. <text:s/>Applejack did a half turn and cocked her legs for a buck in an instant. <text:s/>Wild however was able to catch her intention fast enough to drop to the ground before Applejack could complete her buck. <text:s/>When Applejack overextended herself took to the opening and stood back up causing Applejack to flip over onto her back.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:span text:style-name="T179"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T181">Enough, both of you</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T179">!” </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T180">Rose scolded, “I swear this town is full of children sometimes. <text:s/>You don&apos;t have to like each other, but you do have to remain civil.” <text:s/>Once Applejack returned to hooves Rose asked, “Now are you both calm?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P101"><text:span text:style-name="T180"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T181">Yes,” muttered Applejack.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:span text:style-name="T181"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T182">No,” said Wild causing everyone to turn their attention to her. <text:s/>She was still staring at the same spot, but now the ponies noticed her unfocused eyes. <text:s/>Rose went to try getting Wild&apos;s attention, but Wild shifted over a foot just before Rose&apos;s hoof could reach her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:span text:style-name="T182"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T183">Wild, we are all calming down.” Rose soothed recognizing the symptoms, “Can you do that with us?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:span text:style-name="T183"><text:tab/>“No.” Wild answered.<text:tab/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:span text:style-name="T183"><text:tab/>“Oh come on,” Applejack interrupted, “quit being difficult.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:span text:style-name="T183"><text:tab/>“Oh, um, Applejack you shouldn&apos;t be too hard on her.” Fluttershy pointed out, “If its alright with you let&apos;s go back to Ponyville.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:span text:style-name="T183"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T184">She&apos;s just trying to be difficult.” Applejack argued, “All she needs is some sense knocked into her.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:span text:style-name="T184"><text:tab/>“Applejack, she&apos;s having a panic attack.” Rose explained. <text:s/>She also noted that Wild&apos;s had puffed up her coat. <text:s/>On anyone else it would have been an attempt to seem bigger, but Rose already knew Wild would not need to pretend. <text:s/>Given her abilities this was not something Rose wanted to see tested and implored, “Please, go back to Ponyville with Fluttershy.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:span text:style-name="T184"><text:tab/>“But--” Applejack started, but was interrupted.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:span text:style-name="T184"><text:tab/>“I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t want to see you making the situation any worse.” Rose snapped and this time Applejack begrudgingly listened. <text:s/>She made her way back to Ponyville with Fluttershy, and Rose breathed a sigh when she was out of sight. <text:s/>Rose </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T185">cooed to</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T184"> Wild, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T185">It&apos;s alright dear, you don&apos;t need to be afraid anymore. Can you calm down for me?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T185"><text:tab/>“I...” Wild hesitated before hissing, “I can&apos;t, it might be a trap.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P103"><text:span text:style-name="T185"><text:tab/>“It&apos;s not a trap, we just want to help you.” <text:s/>Twilight pleaded now that she understood what was happening. <text:s/>She also tried to move in for a hug, but Rose stopped her with a hoof. <text:s/>Confused Twilight asked, “The books said to reassure ponies in a panic attack. <text:s/>What&apos;s wrong with giving her a hug?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T261">“A... hug?” said Wild perplexed. <text:s/>Her muzzle scrunched up as her mind went to work on the new information. She whispered, “An interrogator would never risk contacting the infected.” <text:s/>Her coat flattened back down as she realized, “That&apos;s right I already consumed them.” <text:s/>One more realization caused her eyes to widen, and she pulled Twilight into a hug. <text:s/>A few tears landed on Twilight&apos;s back as Wild apologized, “I&apos;m so sorry Twilight. <text:s/>Thank you for trying to give me a hug, but my coat was stiff enough at the time to poke you full of holes. <text:s/>Also the venom would have paralyzed you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T261">Twilight&apos;s eyes shrunk to pin pricks and she whimpered, “Oh, thats a pretty good reason... but how did you know Rose? <text:s/>Also, its nice to meet you, I&apos;m Twilight Sparkle.” <text:s/>Wild released the mare from the hug.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T261">Rose Bloom,” Rose responded, </text:span>“<text:span text:style-name="T261">Her coat puffed up. <text:s/>Animals do that to seem bigger, but I don&apos;t know of any animal larger than a square mile of forest. <text:s/>I figured this scamp here was up to something sneakier.” <text:s/>Rose sighed, “That was a pretty fast emotional turn around you just had, how are you feeling?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T262">Along with having an absurd biology, my brain is just as alien.” Wild lectured, “My mind is a copy of me as a human, but my brain isn&apos;t an organ anymore. <text:s/>The brain in this body is actually defunct, and my entire body function as a distributed brain of sorts. <text:s/>Right now I literally have a brain that spans a chunk of the Everfree, but most of that brain power is spent processing the sensory input of said chunk.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T262">You&apos;re avoiding the topic.” <text:s/>Rose declared while Twilight tried to make sense of the new information. Rose gently continued, “I know you may not want to talk about it, but it really would help. <text:s/>Are you willing to tell us what happened in your past?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T262">I...” Wild stammered, “I don&apos;t know.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T262">I&apos;m willing to wait the entire day if you need, but this has to be your decision.” Rose bargained, “We care about you, Wild.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T263">After considering it, Wild this was ultimately unavoidable for her. <text:s/>She relented, “Alright, I doubt there will be a better time for this, but first trying to maintain two bodies is getting to be a headache.” <text:s/>She walked over to a tree and hung her bag on a convenient low branch. <text:s/>She sat down against the trunk and leaned back into the tree. <text:s/>To the surprise of the other ponies Wild closed her eyes, and bark grew across her coat to securing her to the tree. <text:s/>“Ok, I need more practice with multiple bodies, its harder than I thought,” She effused now that she only had to manage a single immobile form.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T264">How are you speaking,” Twilight inquired looking around for the source of Wild&apos;s voice.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T264">It&apos;s the leaves. <text:s/>I learned how to reproduced sounds for amusement, pretty helpful now.” Wild explained.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T264">You&apos;re stalling again” Rose said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T264">Right,” Wild conceded, “first I would like to emphasize that I was among the weakest physically. <text:s/>I&apos;m not much of a fighter, even now after taking over these trees I would not stand a chance if I tried to fight in fair battle. <text:s/>So, I spent most of the time hiding as one of the other refugees in the city. <text:s/>I even ended being called Athena. <text:s/>Not accurate, but no one knew my real name. <text:s/>The worst part was that safety was only couple miles away, but we were quarantined and no one could be bothered to simply let the uninfected out. <text:s/>I know they could detect the virus, they just didn&apos;t care.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T264">Twilight and Rose were laying down at this point just listening. <text:s/>Wild continued, “The whole disaster ended up being some unholy cross between a zombie plague, and a miniature war. <text:s/>The refugees were neutral which just meant that we were simply used by the two factions involved. <text:s/>Blacklight, a secret paramilitary group, used us as test subjects. <text:s/>The infected just viewed us as food. Now, the infected at the beginning were almost entirely zombies. <text:s/>There were two exceptions the one who released the infection and me. <text:s/>We were the only two that could control it through some quirk of fate. <text:s/>Unfortunately, my parents and me were all infected shortly after the initial outbreak.” <text:s/>Wild paused as she remembered the event. <text:s/>“That was the second worst time of my life. <text:s/>My entire body was ripped apart and reassembled and I remained conscious through the whole process. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t even get enough time to catch my breath before being attacked. <text:s/>My parents died and were twisted into deformed caricatures of a human that were barely recognizable and they were hostile to everything. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t look infected so they attacked, but I wasn&apos;t human so they couldn&apos;t infect me or kill me. <text:s/>I was cut and ripped to pieces before they left me for dead.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T265">Both ponies were crying at that point, allowing Wild to reflect on the memory. <text:s/>She realized that her parents were never properly laid to rest. <text:s/>None of her friends and family were for that matter. <text:s/>There was never an opportunity back then, but now she could give them a memorial. <text:s/>She could actually get some closure.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T265">Rose was the first to speak up, “I don&apos;t know what to say. <text:s/>You&apos;ve gone through more than anyone in Equestria has save for the Princesses.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T265">Don&apos;t worry, just listening is enough.” <text:s/>Wild reassured, “It actually is nice to finally talk about it. <text:s/>I couldn&apos;t before since it would have given away what I was.” <text:s/>A tension that had been with her was eased, but it was replaced by another when she thought about the next part of her story. “Are...” she began, but hesitated. <text:s/>“Are you still willing to hear the next part? <text:s/>It only gets worse at this point.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T266">Both ponies just nodded to that. <text:s/>Wild was still reluctant, as she collected her memories of that time. <text:s/>She had buried them, but now they would be revealed. <text:s/>She would also have to reveal another fact she did not want to admit, even to herself. <text:s/>She steeled her resolve, ready to take the plunge despite the risks. <text:s/>She confessed, “I&apos;m a murderer.” <text:s/>As expected she was met with confusion, but with the first step taken it was easier. <text:s/>“I&apos;ve killed and eaten people, over a hundred at this point. <text:s/>Many of them innocent, but some of them were irredeemably evil. <text:s/>Those ones I enjoyed. <text:s/>I hate that I enjoyed it, but </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T266">I really did want those ones to suffer.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T266">Rose had a pensive expression, but Twilight looked like someone had just jammed a lemon in her mouth. <text:s/>Rose had only a single, “Why tell us this?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T266">I hate hiding, that was what let Blackwatch become the monsters they are.” <text:s/>Wild returned since she had been asking herself the same. <text:s/>“Regardless of the results, I just want to stop hiding it, stop worrying about what might happen if you found out. <text:s/>That and I&apos;m of the opinion that its better to air your own dirty laundry than to let someone else do it for you.” <text:s/>The expression confused the other two, but the context was clear enough. <text:s/>Rose seemed satisfied with the explanation, but Twilight was not.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T266">Surely there was a better way, you didn&apos;t need to kill them.” <text:s/>Twilight blurted out.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T266">There may have been a better way for the evil ones, but I&apos;m not perfect. <text:s/>Everyone has they&apos;re breaking point and they pushed my past mine.” <text:s/>Wild reasoned, “You can judge for yourself after hearing what they did, but I do not regret killing them. <text:s/>The innocent ones were a different matter completely, I still can&apos;t see a way they could have survived. <text:s/>The only mercy I could give them was a quick death.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T266">Seeing Twilight build up for an argument Rose butted in, “Twilight, let&apos;s hear the full story first. <text:s/>Not everywhere is as peaceful as Equestria, and sometimes killing really is the kindest thing you can do.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T266">Thank you.” Wild said, “This part of my life is where I picked up most of my neurosis. <text:s/>I learned the hard way that regeneration and a photographic memory can be double edged swords. <text:s/>At the time I was still new to my abilities, and they mostly worked on their own. <text:s/>Fire and automatic regeneration are a terrible combination. <text:s/>The first time I encountered it was from a Molotov cocktail, a glass bottle with alcohol and a burning rag in it. <text:s/>One the other refugees discovered my infection and hit with it. <text:s/>The regeneration made sure that my nerves worked as the fire continuously ate away at my flesh. <text:s/>It would have killed me, but I wasn&apos;t that lucky. <text:s/>Instead some nearby Blackwatch members heard the screaming, and put out the fire. <text:s/>They didn&apos;t let me die, I was too useful to them instead I was kept in a glass cage. <text:s/>I have no idea how long I was in there, there only thing to judge the passage of time with were the... feedings”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T266">Rose&apos;s face paled as she realized the implication and tried to deny, “No, please don&apos;t tell me they...” <text:s/>She couldn&apos;t finish the thought, and Twilight was left confused.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T266">What were they doing?” Twilight worried looking between the two ponies.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T266">I think Rose guessed it, but these people value efficiency above ethics. <text:s/>I wasn&apos;t the only infected they had captured, and despite how strange out metabolism may be, it still existed. <text:s/>We needed to be fed if they wanted us alive, and there happened to be a large source food nearby if you lack morals. <text:s/>They fed us the refugees, they just tossed them into the cages and then no more refugee. <text:s/>It was also a convenient way for them to dispose of bodies too.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T266">Now enlightened, Twilight responded by violently purging her stomach on the nearest tree. <text:s/></text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T266">Glad for a reprieve from the current topic Wild commented, “Twilight, you seem to be making a habit out of this. <text:s/>Although I probably am the only pony who doesn&apos;t mind being vomited on.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T266">But I didn&apos;t hit you.” <text:s/>Twilight countered.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T266">Deciding it would be a good idea to mark which trees were her, Wild grew tendrils on the trunks of each tree colored to match her coat. <text:s/>It looked like vines had suddenly engulfed the forest. <text:s/>Then she explained, “I literally am every tree with a green trunk. <text:s/>Something I did not consider the implication of properly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T266">Oh,” Twilight choked, “and I just... <text:s/>I&apos;m so sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T266">Seriously, don&apos;t worry about it.” <text:s/>Wild chuckled, “I cover hundreds of acres, you aren&apos;t even the only creature currently making a mess on me. <text:s/>One of those implication that I didn&apos;t consider.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T266">Oh, yuck, Wild.” both ponies complained in unison at the imagery. <text:s/>Rose continued, “We should get back on topic though. <text:s/>I get the impression there&apos;s still more to come.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T267">There is, Blackwatch was very interested in me since I was one of two known anomalies with the Blacklight virus. <text:s/>In order to aid their study of me, they required my cooperation be it voluntary or forced. <text:s/>I assume there are magical methods of mental control.” Receiving a nod from Twilight, Wild continued, “Well, I don&apos;t know what they are like but the mundane ways to brainwash someone are brutal. <text:s/>Fire is one of the few things that produced a &apos;satisfactory response&apos; as the scientist put it, so that&apos;s what they use to control me for the most part. <text:s/>I was too stubborn for that to break me though, so they moved onto psychological tactics.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T267">The leaves on every one of Wild&apos;s trees shook briefly before she continued, “That was what finally broke my will completely. <text:s/>At least as far as they knew. <text:s/>Turns out that having a conscience can be a problem when dealing with monsters. <text:s/>I hated feeding time, but I had to eat. <text:s/>At first it wasn&apos;t too bad though, the food was brought in dead. <text:s/>I could rationalize that easily, they&apos;re dead they don&apos;t need a body anymore after all. <text:s/>It maybe cold, but that got me through most of the time. <text:s/>Then I tried to defy them, and that&apos;s the first time I got to experience a live feeding. <text:s/>They put some man into the cage with me and left.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T267">Wild hesitated before she could get the next part. <text:s/>When she was able to progress again the volume of her voice wavered from the emotions as she stammered, “At first I was confused about why they would put him here. <text:s/>My guess was that he was supposed to be a spectator when they brought the dead body later. <text:s/>Soon enough confusion gave way to boredom and we both sat in our own little corners until our keepers returned. <text:s/>Only they didn&apos;t, and I was the first to realize what was going on when the hunger pangs showed up. <text:s/>I don&apos;t experience hunger the same way as you, instead of sensation its just the knowledge that I am running low on energy. <text:s/>Then as I get lower my mind starts getting fuzzier, I think slower, my vision gets worse, and I start to lose focus on things. <text:s/>The last thing I saw was the terror on the man face as my body began falling apart. <text:s/>Then I woke up in his body slumped against the wall of the cage and looking at my own corpse. <text:s/>The best I can figure out is that whatever mental connection the virus produces failed and it reverted back to its default highly infectious state.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T267">This time it was Rose that had the most dramatic reaction. <text:s/>She had to get up before the Wild even finished and expelled her own stomach. <text:s/>What came out though was not what Wild expected. <text:s/>It was thick dark green fluid that glowed slightly. <text:s/>She made a note of the oddity and collected the fluid to investigate later. <text:s/>Sitting back down Rose rasped, “How are you still sane?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T267">There are two answers to that. <text:s/>The Blacklight virus is a very mixed blessing. <text:s/>It is great at copying and storing information, but its not perfect. <text:s/>My emotion are somewhat off, I have less empathy now, and weaker emotional responses. <text:s/>The virus is much more suited to analytical thinking making me more resilient to trauma.” Wild elaborated, “The more significant reason is that, I&apos;m not sane. <text:s/>Not completely at least. <text:s/>You already know my feelings about fire, and I have a compulsion to answer questions. <text:s/>Whatever else they may be Blackwatch is effective and that held true for there interrogations. <text:s/>They wanted reliable answers from me so they made me unable to ignore or knowingly lie when asked a question.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T267">Magic can&apos;t do that.” <text:s/>Twilight stated, “You can&apos;t just make someone tell the truth.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T267">I said knowingly lie. <text:s/>Its not objective truth, its what I regard as true.” <text:s/>Wild corrected, “Also, my world had no magic. <text:s/>Both myself, and everything the Blackwatch does are purely physical.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T267">Twilight cocked her head to the side, but otherwise stayed silent as she contemplated the possibility. <text:s/>However, Rose noticed something else and pointed out, “So that&apos;s what happened with Applejack. <text:s/>We have been forcing you to answer questions.” <text:s/>She went on to inquire, “You became more manipulative to counter it didn&apos;t you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T267">Yes, the original programming was for the complete truth, but I managed to weaken it down to just the technically correct truth. <text:s/>That leaves me with plenty of wiggle room, and I just think of it as a personality quirk.” Wild explained, “Unfortunately, Applejack triggered a relapse. <text:s/>While not verbose, I would have answered any question honestly and directly.” <text:s/>As an after thought Wild added, “Please, don&apos;t try to abuse that. <text:s/>Along with the obvious, it&apos;s also dangerous. <text:s/>You could easily be labeled as Blackwatch agents in that state with possibly... fatal consequences.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T268">How much danger was she in?” Rose demanded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T268">Relatively little, but still too much.” Wild confessed, “My response to her were escalating, and if she pushed enough...” Wild trailed off before quickly pointing out, “She would have a hard time actually hurting me, and probably would have ended up temporarily paralyzed at worst.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T268">Rose sighed, “I&apos;ll have to talk with her about picking her fights better.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T268">Also, there&apos;s one more part left.” Wild added.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T268">It gets worse!” Twilight exclaimed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T268">Yes, that wasn&apos;t the only live feeding. <text:s/>After that one though I didn&apos;t let myself starve again. <text:s/>Instead I would try talking to them and killing them quickly while distracted. <text:s/>It was as much as I could <text:s/>do for them.” <text:s/>Wild said before explaining, “Assuming that the memories are intact, I end up with a copy when I consume a creature. <text:s/>I have the memories from every single person I&apos;ve killed, its more </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T268">trouble than its worth. <text:s/>For most its just having to experience their death that&apos;s the worst. <text:s/>Seeing from their perspective as I watch myself kill them, knowing every thought going through their head at the time. <text:s/>The Blackwatch guys were the worst though. <text:s/>Their monstrous acts weren&apos;t limited to me and I got see all of their crimes, all of their victims. <text:s/>I got to know with certainty that the were enjoying every second of it. <text:s/>I also got to see that they were not happy with me trying to be nice to my victims.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T268">Building up steam behind her rant Wild seethed, “I don&apos;t know how, but they found my best friend, Jenell Patterson. <text:s/>She was my last friend too. <text:s/>Before the outbreak I was just an average teenage girl with plenty of friends doing teenage girl stuff. <text:s/>Unfortunately, teenage girls don&apos;t have a good survival rate in zombie infested ruins. <text:s/>We all died in the end. <text:s/>Instead of staying dead though I got to be the one to kill the last of my friends. <text:s/>Unlike the others they told her what was happening before dumping her in my cage. <text:s/>For instant she was happy to see someone familiar before remember what I am and switched to terror. <text:s/>Then I saw the moment her brain kicked in and she realized why she was really there. <text:s/>That she was being used to break me. <text:s/>I just sat there like a lump repeat the word &apos;no&apos; when she offered to kill herself. <text:s/>She figured that she wasn&apos;t getting out of there alive regardless, so why not made it easier for me. <text:s/>I also later learned that she thought that having her entire life permanently etched into my memory was a better remembrance than most people got. <text:s/>In the end though a glass jar doesn&apos;t give many options to kill oneself and I had to do it. <text:s/>We hugged one last time, and right before the end she said &apos;I&apos;m sorry&apos;.” Wild wailed, “She apologized to me even though I wasn&apos;t the one that was going to die.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P102"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T269">Everfree weather was always strange, but this was the only time it rained without a single cloud in the sky.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:h text:style-name="P112" text:outline-level="1">Chapter 11</text:h>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T269">Most of the morning had passed by the time that the ponies recovered. <text:s/>There was still one question that Rose and Twilight had not gotten the answer to. <text:s/>“How did you escape?” Rose asked, “I can&apos;t imagine they just let you go after all of that.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T270">They didn&apos;t. <text:s/>I don&apos;t really know if it was negligence or complacency, but they let the cage deteriorate. <text:s/>In order to actually contain me they needed a hermetically sealed container, but I still need oxygen in order to breathe so there was self contained unit that recycled the air in the chamber. <text:s/>The unit was in a separate location though with a duct connecting the two.” <text:s/>Wild explained, “In an act of petty defiance I would probe the cage daily for weakness. <text:s/>I guess they never noticed since they never punished me for it. <text:s/>One day I found the weakness I needed, the seal between the cage and the air duct was cracked. <text:s/>I couldn&apos;t fit my whole body through that, but I could send a dust sized piece of myself through. <text:s/>That was all it took, slowly I used that little piece to collect biomass outside while keeping it hidden. <text:s/>I don&apos;t regret what I did after that,” she sighed, “but I cannot deny that it was a brutal and merciless act.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T271">Wild&apos;s friends were paying rapt attention at this point, though their ears folded back at the last statement. <text:s/>“I figured &apos;hey I&apos;m basically a disease why not act like it&apos;. <text:s/>I infect the first person I could </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T271">and set up a little beachhead for myself. <text:s/>I didn&apos;t want to be noticed though so I stayed asymptomatic and just worked on being infectious. <text:s/>A sneeze here, or unwashed hands was enough to spread me without any of them noticing. <text:s/>They actually did have detectors in case of containment breach, they never considered that I might take the slow methodical route though. <text:s/>The amount of infection in each person was too small for them to detect so I could basically move freely.” <text:s/>Wild laughed, “The preparation were completed without incident and that was the first time I smiled since the outbreak. <text:s/>I think one of the guards noticed, but by then I was letting the virus run wild in all of them. <text:s/>I just sat in my cage listening to the sirens going off and watching the panic in the nearby guards. <text:s/>There was nothing they could do at that point, the entire facility had been infected at the same time as far as they could tell for the few minutes they had to live. <text:s/>From there all I had to do was pick a body and walk out.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T271">That&apos;s...” Twilight started, but couldn&apos;t finish. <text:s/>She sat there wide eyed, not know what to think.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T271">Monstrous.” Wild finished for her, “I know. <text:s/>I don&apos;t have a justification for it, but I didn&apos;t get out of without consequence either. <text:s/>That was what earned me the code name Athena, and shot me to the top of their list of targets, on par with the one who released the virus in the first place. <text:s/>Also I consumed all of those people, I got all of their memories. <text:s/>They were all Blackwatch members, and now I have to live with detailed knowledge of every crime they committed. <text:s/>I basically inherited all of their sins. <text:s/>In the end they broke me, but they didn&apos;t expect that I would remake myself into a monster to break them in return. <text:s/>The only redeeming quality being that I only target bigger monsters.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T271">I don&apos;t know what to think.” Twilight glumly said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T271">All I can tell you is that there are no black and whites, everything is a shade of gray.” Wild replied, “Blackwatch was originally created to protect the people. <text:s/>The lost their way, but even now they still have the same goal. <text:s/>It&apos;s just been twisted beyond recognition.” <text:s/>She took the time to shift back into her pony body since the worst of the conversation was over.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T271">As far as I am concerned, having to live with all of the memories is a better penance than anything I could do.” <text:s/>Rose asserted. <text:s/>She frowned in thought before asking, “Would you do any of that in Equestria?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T271">Wild frowned in return, met Rose&apos;s eyes and stated, “Yes, its not just self-deprecation when I say I&apos;m a monster. <text:s/>I would kill them all over again if I were back in that situation, and I would do the same for any Equestrian monsters as well. <text:s/>Though even that bomb the other day is nowhere near what it would take for me to respond that way. <text:s/>I would rather just let the guards handle it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T271">Rose shook her head and snorted, “Not ideal, but then I suppose nothing is perfect. <text:s/>At least you acknowledge your faults. <text:s/>You may be a monster, but you are also a good pony.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T271">How can you be both?” Twilight puzzled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T271">One bad trait doesn&apos;t make all the others bad.” <text:s/>Rose explained, “Although, there may be a correlation between there.” <text:s/>Twilight did not look convinced, but her stomach had its own argument. <text:s/>It growled loud enough for everyone to hear as she blushed. <text:s/>“It is about lunch time.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T271">The three ponies headed back to Ponyville. <text:s/>Rose split off to go find Applejack, Twilight returned to her library, and Wild decided to continue camping in front of the fountain again. <text:s/>This time she was paying attention for any suspicious ponies which was easy since the rest of the town was giving her a wide berth. <text:s/>While waiting to see if someone would talk with her Wild decided to play around with her new forest. <text:s/>She want to add sonar to the trees. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T44">Huh, I think I might be paranoid, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T186">Wild wondered, </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T44">but damn it I like seeing everything around me. <text:s/>And they actually are out to get me.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T186"><text:tab/>Her waiting payed off in a sense, a pony actually approached Wild. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T187">When she opened her eyes she found Lyra approaching her with a blank expression. <text:s/>Stopping in front of Wild, Lyra just stared for a second before asking, “Do you have any concept of subtlety?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T187"><text:tab/>“I was pretty good at it before I got here. <text:s/>Now that I think about it that probably had more to do with the number of people, and everyone worrying about not dying.” <text:s/>Wild answered not sure where this was going. “Maybe not.” Wild concluded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T187"><text:tab/>“You stick out like a sore hoof.” Lyra groaned planting her face in her hooves. <text:s/>“You really did take over a chunk of the Everfree forest, didn&apos;t you?” She accused.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T187"><text:tab/>“Yes, nobody was using it, so it seemed like a good idea at the time...” Wild confessed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T187"><text:tab/>“Why?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T187"><text:tab/>“Oh, I want to build a house there.” Wild professed, “</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T188">I think its lovely location now that I can keep all of the larger creatures away.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T188"><text:tab/>“You needed a whole square mile for a house?” <text:s/>Lyra deadpanned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T188"><text:tab/>“Yep,” <text:s/>Wild chirped, “most of it is a buffer to keep out unwanted visitors, but I&apos;ll make a pond, and maybe some other landscaping.” <text:s/>Her ears lowered when she said, “I also want to make a memorial.” <text:s/>That got a few gasps from the ponies that had start gathering to watch the conversation. <text:s/>Its not everyday you get to watch the two craziest ponies in town argue. <text:s/>They did not expect that last comment. <text:s/>“I&apos;ve already lost everything else, I only have memories left. <text:s/>So I&apos;m going to make a memorial for them when I can find the materials.” <text:s/>Wild declared.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T188"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T189">Hearing that the spectating ponies did not know what to say. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T188">“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T189">How did you lose them?” a mare asked from behind the crowd. <text:s/>The mare made her way to the front and revealed herself as Applejack.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“A plague struck the city I lived in.” Wild responded surprised that Applejack wanted know, “I lost some to plague itself, but it was a slow attrition as everything around us fell apart. <text:s/>Lack of food, or clean water and exposure to the winter ended up being too much. <text:s/>I am the only one that managed to escape.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“You must be pretty special, how did you escape?” <text:s/>Applejack inquired now joined in the group with Lyra and Wild.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“I didn&apos;t think I was that special, but someone else did. <text:s/>I was summoned here by someone named Gaia.” <text:s/>Wild said, “I&apos;m not really sure why. <text:s/>She basically just said &apos;I brought you here, have fun&apos; and left me in the Everfree forest.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“Gaia?” both Applejack and Lyra questioned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“She also said some called her Mother Earth.” Wild supplied.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“That explains some things.” Lyra mumbled.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>Applejack decided to switch topics and challenged, “What did you mean when you said you took over part of the Everfree forest? <text:s/>You some kind of forest spirit?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“No” Wild stated at the same time as Lyra stated, “Yes”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“Well which is it?” Applejack demanded.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“She is literally part of the forest now. <text:s/>She controls the plants and land, and can project herself through them from what I understand. <text:s/>Even if she hasn&apos;t realized it yet, she is the spirit of the Everfree forest. <text:s/>Well, a relatively small part of it at least.” answered Lyra before Wild could respond.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“Huh, I never thought about it like that.” Wild mused with a hoof on her chin, “Yeah, I guess I am a forest spirit now. <text:s/>Neat.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“So, you&apos;re not some kinda zombie?” Applejack asked with narrowed eyes.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>Wild went to answer, but Lyra put her hoof in Wild&apos;s mouth. <text:s/>“She means undead, with necromancy and all that implies.” Lyra addressed to Wild before reclaiming her hoof.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“Oh, no I&apos;m not undead or anything. <text:s/>Just a 19 year old girl thats been through too much including dieing a couple times. <text:s/>My ability to heal myself still works if I&apos;m technically dead.” <text:s/>Wild answered while Lyra face hoofed.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“That sounds to me like you used necromancy.” Applejack accused before pulling out a strange object. <text:s/>It was a metal disc about the size of a hoof with an ankh engraved into it. <text:s/>She tossed it to Wild who caught it on reflex to the surprise of Applejack.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“Nope, just normal cell division accelerated a little.” Wild countered as she inspected the new object. <text:s/>“What&apos;s this thing? <text:s/>Some kind of coin or something?” <text:s/>Wild asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“It&apos;s a ward of life, if you had been undead it would have disrupted the magic animating you.” <text:s/>Lyra explained and turned to Applejack. <text:s/>“I assume you believe us now.” she insisted.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T189"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T190">Alright,” Applejack relented and her ears drooped. <text:s/>“I was wrong about you Wild Way. <text:s/>I&apos;m sorry for how I&apos;ve been treating you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T190"><text:tab/>“I forgive you.” Wild replied, “and here is your thingy back.” She hoofed the disc back to Applejack who put it away.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T190"><text:tab/>The crowd had started to wander off when a wagon entered the square drawing their attention. <text:s/>When it stopped in an empty area a stage popped out and a blue unicorn mare with a light blue mane stepped out. <text:s/>She was wearing a cape, and wizard hat with stars on it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T190"><text:tab/>“A magic show?” marveled Wild, “What&apos;s a magic like with real magic?” <text:s/>The trio went to join </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T190">the rest of the crowd watching the show. <text:s/>Applejack wander off when she saw one of her friends, but Lyra stayed next to Wild. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T191">The stage mare introduced herself as The Great and Powerful Trixie, and proceeded to perform a variety of basic tricks, after bragging about vanquishing an Ursa Major.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T191"><text:tab/>“Alright, this is less interesting than I imagined.” Wild pouted, Lyra just shrugged. <text:s/>Then Trixie challenged the town. <text:s/>First Applejack went up there and did a series of lasso tricks. <text:s/>Trixie countered by using the lasso to hog tie Applejack. <text:s/>Next up was a blue pegasus with rainbow mane, she did some aerial tricks and made a rainbow upon landing. <text:s/>Trixie used lightning clouds to shock the mare off the stage. <text:s/>The final challenge was a white unicorn with curly purple mane. <text:s/>She created a costume out of pieces from the stage, but Trixie just turned her mane green. <text:s/>That was enough for the white unicorn as she ran off crying. <text:s/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T192">Well, that was a let down. <text:s/>At least the ponies from ponyville were pretty talented.” <text:s/>Wild sighed then added, “I would like to see her take on an Ursa Major though.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T192"><text:tab/>“A traveling performer and the only good thing about her show were the local ponies.” Lyra agrees and shakes her head. <text:s/>“She would get torn apart by the Ursa.” Lyra retorts.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P104"><text:span text:style-name="T192"><text:tab/>“Not if she runs fast enough.” <text:s/>Lyra goes her own way and Wild returns to trying to set up forest wide echolocation. <text:s/>By the evening she managed to get the network of sensors working for her and integrated to created one continuous view of her entire forest. <text:s/>Already she had found some interesting things since she was better able to judge size. <text:s/>There were about half a dozen changelings hanging out in the branches, presumably </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T193">lookouts for the hive. <text:s/>There were also a pair of small ponies running through the forest, but they were too far away to get a clear image of. <text:s/>The fact that the ground started shaking slightly after they passed was suspicious. <text:s/>Increasing the height of one of her trees Wild was able to see of the rest of the Everfree forest and spotted an Ursa Minor. <text:s/>“Seriously, at least its only a minor one. <text:s/>Um, what to do.” Wild complained before deciding that Twilight was the closest person she knew that might be able to help. <text:s/>She did not want to kill it since it was only a child.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>Wild had her roots increase their density in an empty patch of her forest, and five groups of trees to twist together into large columns. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>While this was happening she had her pony body run to Twilight&apos;s library. <text:s/>“Twilight, we got a problem.” Wild shouted and banged on the door. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>Her roots had finished growing and created a solid mass in the general shape of a pony without legs or abdomen. <text:s/>The head raised above the forest floor. <text:s/>The outside of the mass had formed an even tighter mesh to point of essentially being armored. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“Twilight” Wild continued to shout while dancing in place anxious to get the mare&apos;s attention. <text:s/>The Ursa was just a few hundred feet from her forest which meant that it was less than a mile away. <text:s/>Twilight opened the door and asked, “What is it?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>Back in her forest the torso of her construct was being lifted by the five columns that had connected to it. <text:s/>One for each leg and the last for a tail. <text:s/>The columns were being filled out for extra muscle mainly in the hind legs. <text:s/>The tail was changing into a collection of vines and had separated from the ground already.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“There&apos;s an Ursa Minor heading to the town and its only half a mile away. <text:s/>I&apos;m going to stop it from entering but I was hoping you had a good way of getting it to leave.” Wild blurted out. <text:s/>As an afterthought she added, “Oh, and two young ponies were running through the Everfree forest right before it showed up. <text:s/>I&apos;m going to head over there now.” <text:s/>Wild began walking toward the forest where she figured the giant would appear.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>Wild&apos;s giant was almost complete and had the general shape of a pony albeit an unnatrually thin one. <text:s/>In order to make it more friendly looking she added green moss to fill in the silhouette. <text:s/>Each leg lifted one by one to test it and detach it from the ground. <text:s/>The construct bent down and jumped over the <text:s/>forest between it and the plain outside of town.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>Wild had stopped just past the edge of town and watched her timber pony come in for a landing. <text:s/>The colts had already run past so the landing area was clear and the Ursa Minor was only a few seconds from appearing out of the tree line.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>Twilight, the timber pony and the ursa minor all showed up at the same time. <text:s/>The ursa minor was giant bear with a coat that appeared like the night sky. <text:s/>It was the same height as the surrounding trees and Wild&apos;s timber pony though it out massed the collection of dirt and trees. <text:s/>Twilight had stopped <text:s/>right next to Wild and just stared at the giant creatures in front of her. <text:s/>The bear was not as hesitant and charge the giant pony. <text:s/>The giant pony shifted to face the bear and braced for the impact by digging into the ground. <text:s/>A loud clap sounded as the pair collided and while the pony held out against the charge parts of the outer layers were knocked off.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“The pony ones mine, if you have a plan for the bear now would be the time.” Wild explained without moving her body. <text:s/>Trying to maintain two was still beyond her but since the giant did not have eyes or mouth she could use the ones on her main body. <text:s/>Fortunately the bear was not able to get past Wild and just tried to bash apart the cobbled together body. <text:s/>Some cracks appeared and dirt would spill out but they would heal just a quickly.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>Twilight set to work using the wind and some nearby cattails to play a lullaby. <text:s/>She also grabbed a water tower and filled it with milk. <text:s/>The ursa minor was more amicable and accepted the makeshift bottle. <text:s/>A little bit of rocking while levitating and the bear cub was asleep again.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“I can take him back if you put him on the pony&apos;s back.” Wild offered and Twilight gently placed the ursa minor on the giant pony. <text:s/>Both giants then headed off into the forest following the trail the bear had left earlier. <text:s/>“Well, this has been an interesting day, but I think I am ready for it to end.” Wild stated.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“Agreed.” Twilight mumbled and gets a look of curiosity. <text:s/>“How are you navigating the giant pony? <text:s/>It didn&apos;t have eyes and you can&apos;t see it from here.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“Sonar. <text:s/>I&apos;ve had a lot of time to kill so I spent it tinkering with abilities. <text:s/>Acoustics tended to be a common area for me to tinker in.” Wild answered. <text:s/>“I could reproduce practically any kind of sound, but I haven&apos;t figured out how to make a sonic cannon yet.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“You&apos;re trying to make a weapon?” Twilight challenged with a scowl.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“Not really, thats just a name. <text:s/>A sonic cannon produces sound in a beam instead of an expanding sphere. <text:s/>One thing that I learned from getting all that knowledge from Blackwatch is that anything can be turned into a weapon with enough creativity. <text:s/>I also believe that any weapon can be turned, as it were, back into a plowshare.” Wild elaborated, “For a sonic cannon it all depends on the volume. <text:s/>Loud enough and you have a weapon, but keeping it to a normal volume you have a neat way to transit sound much further than you otherwise could.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>The ursa made it back to its mother and the giant pony went to return to the ground it was formed from. <text:s/>Twilight looked pensive when she commented, “You are one hard to understand mare.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“Maybe, but I think the real problem is I don&apos;t fit into existing categories.” Wild giggled at Twilight&apos;s consternation. <text:s/>“Alright, the ursa&apos;s back home, and now all thats left is clean up.” Wild said.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>At this point Lucent had made his way to the two mares after calming the crowd that had shown up to the earlier spectacle. <text:s/>“Hello, Miss Way. <text:s/>I take it this was another attempt on your life?” he questioned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“No, actually this one was just a couple of local colts. <text:s/>I noticed them running through the Everfree chased by the ursa. <text:s/>I get the feeling they were doing something ill advised, but not malicious.” Wild recounted causing Lucent to rub his forehead.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“This town is going to be the death of me.” Lucent grumbled. <text:s/>“And that wooden golem? <text:s/>I take that was yours.” <text:s/>he inquired standing in front of Wild. <text:s/>Her ears folded back when she realized that Lucent probably did not know of her recent activities.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“Well, you already know what I can do, and that wasn&apos;t a golem that was still me. <text:s/>I got the material for it from the Everfree forest.” <text:s/>Wild responded but did not want to meet his eyes. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t know if you heard, but I am now literally part of the forest. <text:s/>Specifically the part with all the vine covered trees. <text:s/>That giant was only a minute fraction of my total mass that I cobbled together for this.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“And how much is your total mass?” Lucent deadpanned.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P105"><text:span text:style-name="T193"><text:tab/>“Don&apos;t you know not to ask a lady her weight.” <text:s/>Wild scolded, but Lucent did not react. <text:s/>“I don&apos;t know how much I weigh. <text:s/>I&apos;ve never measured the weight of a forest.” <text:s/>Wild relented. <text:s/>Lucent had a few more logistics questions, but once that was done he and the other ponies had wandered off. <text:s/>Wild decided that she was over due for a nap. <text:s/>A nice 36-hour nap.</text:span></text:p>
